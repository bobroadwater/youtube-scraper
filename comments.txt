Thanks again for inviting me to join! Can’t wait to see your update! What do you think of the CP Jelly much formula!?Ok 30 uses on the super shocks doesn't seem that bad. I think I could manage that. Thanks for mentioning that. I'm really thinking about joining this project. I have so many cream products I need to use up.4.5 mls is the full size of the Stila. I have that same exact one. It is lovely! Going to go pan some cream things now :)Wow red shadows! I struggle so much with them even though I have over 2 red eyeshadow in my stash!

Sorry I didnt know you co-created... ill mention you from now on in this project. Thanks 💝🎀Those colour pop shadows are so gorgeous 😍 Also loving your eye look in this video :)OMG Blitzen.......I'm in love. I just got a Jelly Much for Christmas.

Thanks so much for creating this!That is such a beautiful shade on the super shock shadow!!!I can't wait to jump in on instagram.  You ladies are awesome!Great choices. They are all stunning. I think you can finish that color tattoo. I have finished 2 in my lifetime and it takes about a year. Good luck. Can’t wait to see and thank you for letting me join!I really like your fiery orange look! My jellymuch eyeshadow dried up probably around 5 month mark. Even with Inglot’s duraline, I can’t get it to work as well as it did. I’m so upset because it was the color I absolutely loved. It’s called Spindle from the Disney Villains collectionI think it’s called the color tattoo in the us as well (at least on Ulta)! I can’t wait to see your progress, you’re going to do great! Thanks for including me 🥰❣️ i’m rooting for you!Oh my Blitzen 🦌 What a bright, beautiful shade!Girl!

You got it right the first time, Lyons sounds like lions. Thank you so much for the beautiful intro and for joining Szanny. I love the products you chose. The contour is especially beautiful.Those paint pots seem tough, but I'm excited to see how you do! Thank you so much for joining!Those paint pots seem tough, but I'm excited to see how you do!Your eyeshadow is beautiful!❤️I think going with the amount of time you’re using things is a smart thing to do! Good luck, and can’t wait to keep watching!So excited you are doing this project! I agree about Stila glitters, I’m kind of over them. I need to use mine up! Can’t wait for your first update! ❤️I want to buy that color pop blush, because it’s so pretty! I wish you the best of luck with this project. I can’t wait to see your progress! ❤️Ooh, you picked some really good products! I can't wait to follow along!Good luck! I like the idea of setting use goals, I did that too!I love that you are setting a 10 use goal on some of your products.  Great way to get usage without spending the entire year on them.Good luck with this project! So encouraging to see so many of us doing this together!I'm so excited to be a part of this collab with you! I'm starting to feel the same way about the Stila Liquid Glitters - they tend to dry up before I feel like I've used them enough to warrant the hefty price tag!Yayyy!!! I am so excited to be participating in this project with you!!!!! ❤❤❤❤ I cannot wait to see your progress!!!That ColourPop blush looks amazing 😍I like the ten uses concept. Good luck with the stick blush.You picked some good ones. Can’t wish to see how you do!Good luck with your panning!! ❤️ I LOVE the color of your shirt 😍you pick great products! That blush stix is gorgeousI am terrified of cream products, but I am sure you will do great as always, Ioana! TFS! ~ NonaThis is such an exciting project. You'll smash it. I think it's an unwritten rule to have a Stila glitter and glow, a supershock shadow or a maybelline color tattoo 😂 We're all pulling out the pretty things we've ignored for ages so we'll all look amazing through the project.Stila glitters seem to be prominent in the videos ive seen so far haha. I love the products you've chosen. Thank you so much for joining and im excited to follow along.Happy 2020!  I'm eager to see your usage/success with using the Stila glitters-- do you plan to use it in a day-to-day look (going to work?)-- I'm curious how to use them in a day-to-day way, so I'm curious!  I go back & forth on cream products.   I feel like I have to go "all cream" or "all powder"-- which isn't true, but I worry about mixing.  But I try the cream-only days on weekends.  I think ultimately I like it- but the wear-time isn't great.. so I avoid using them on workdays.  When you said you "set your blush with powder" it gave me hope!  Thanks as always for your videos.I'm so excited that you are doing this project! Great picks! I'm so excited to follow along!Yaaaayyyyy. I've added this to the playlist i can't wait to watch yaayy❤❤❤❤ thanks so much for doing joining.I'm joining in too, this project is such a great idea! Good luck with your products!Love this idea! I'm trying to use up a couple lipsticks, a liquid eyeliner and cream blush. So excited to do my no buy for the year and actually use up some products so I don't waste product and money.Yeah, this is a great idea to use up cream products, and as a nerd I love the pun-ny title tooI have a Stila glitter in mine too 😅 Good luck to us! Girl you said use 10 times I mentioned 100 times for something in mine 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣 you’ll see in the morning 😅Wow I’m early! Great video ma’am!You picked really challenging products! Good luck!I love that you are focusing on your oldest palette. So happy to have found your channel because of this collab!!Those are very challenging products! I wish you the best of luck with them! ❤️Wow so many products!! 🙀 good luck looking forward to your update! 😊Good luck! I am working on a cream and liquid blush too, it seems daunting right now. Your eye look is beautiful!Good luck with this project! So encouraging to see so many of us doing this together!Good luck with your project!I love that you incorporated some cream palettes and a liquid blush - I don't really see those getting used up very often <33:08 Could you depot the contour, i.e. move the pan to a separate container?Good luck with your panning! Lots of cheek products, I love it. 💜good luck on the this project, you picked great products!Also, I’d love to know what shade/brand your bottom eyeliner is in this video, it looks plum and I’m living for it.Yayyyyyy I’m so happy you’re doing this project❣️ so happy to be nosy and see what everyone is doing.This project would be the death of me. Lol! I am terrified of cream products bc I am combo to oily. Lol! Best of luck with it! TFS! ~ NonaI've always been so curious about those nars blushes! Great picks! Thank you for joining us!Your face paint photo is so cool 😍!Good luck on the project! I’m excited so many of us are joining!I love your eyeshadow look Hélène. I am so happy that you joined.

Also i love the pictures od the weights.Yaaaay I am watching now and I've added you're video to the playlist ❤I'm starting to get excited by all the new YTers im connecting with by doing this project 🤩🤩
Your nails are beautiful, my fave color
Good luck 🍀🍀It’s freezing here too 😆. Good luck with the lip topper. I enjoy that product. Hope you will too.Oh, you can rock a purple look like no other so I am so excited to see you using that purple liner. That lip product from Urban Decay is so dark; it's pretty but so dark. I think it'll work really well as an eye topper. Good luck with everything!I wish you the best of luck! Can’t wait to watch your progress! ☺️Omg your nail color is amazing 😍😍That purple liner is so pretty. Good luck!Fun project!  Cream products, for me, are hard to want to use.  But I think they look better than powders.Jessica how do you zoom through your products so fast??!!! 🥰This is a great idea for a project!  For some time, I’ve been focusing on a bunch of cream products that I want to finish so they don’t go bad.  Some have great progress and some are moving along slowly!That CP eyeliner is so pretty 😍  cute top Jessica!I should re-purchase that elf shimmer palette because I used to LOVE it. And I agree - you can't go wrong with purple! <3The FOMO is real on this one! Wish I could fit it in 😓 loving your nails and top 😊 a hint of spring as I'm buried in snow lolYou look gorgeous jess. Those colors look amazing on you. I'm unofficially joining in on IG. I'm gonna post this one and the 2020 project pan.Lovely manicure...glad you’re doing this project.  I’ll enjoy watching yours for the next ten years 😊Your nails are gorgeous!So excited you are joining too!! And I’m sending you my kid to potty train her with yours. I think they are both the same personality. I’m tense and on edge 😂😂😂 
Can’t wait to see how you do!It’s freezing in NY, hate it!! Can’t wait to see your progress, and that nail polish is great!Good luck with your products!! I love your nail polish! 😍How did I know you would be in on this? Lol! I am terrified of cream products! Lol! Love you! TFS! ~ NonaI was grinning from ear to ear Jessica when watching this. I am so happy, genuinely happy that you wanted to join. Thank you so much. I also have the urban decay and use it on my eyes haha. Im freezing too. Im am LOVING your nails. I am looking forward to following along and your video is in the playlist now.Thank you Jessica! I'm so excited to see how you do. That Urban decay item😍😍😍You got my name right! 🥰🥰🥰😁Good luck! I am loving your nail polish!Great project idea. I need to use more of my cream products.You have picked really interesting products! Good luck!What is that polish on your nails? Ots stunning! You've got some great products there. Love coloured eyeliners for a pop of colour.Yes I like thisI own way too much stuff and I almost bought makeup today and I didn’t cuz I’m trying to do a no buy...and it was dirt cheap. That was so hard! But I have similar in my collection so I had to keep reminding myself.I totally love this project.Jessica, your nails and shirt and makeup look so cute!!! It all matches!Ohh that lip topper color is nice! I have one too and bought it for the eyes I figured if it was good for lips it was fine for the eyes 😅 my video will be up in the morning 😊 good luck we got this 💖What a good idea! I m in!OMG YES!! This is such a smart project. Like you said, they tend to expire more quickly than powder products. I’ll make a note to try this next year since I’m already at 4 projects this year, and I don’t want to overload myself.Great product choices Amanda 👏🏼Everyone needs that friends that pushes them into more projects. 😂 Good luck with all your items!I wish you the best of luck! Can’t wait to see your progress! ☺️I’m not sure I could handle that faulty packaging, woah! I hope you can call it an empty soon, good luck!Hahaha Jessica got you again!  This really is a great project idea because those lingering opened cream products don’t last forever!  I have been focusing on a bunch for some time in my own collection. The next to be finished will be a foundation product and then hopefully followed by a cream blush that just does not want to leave!  That stinks that the Marc Jacobs packaging is no good.  If it’s broken and messy, I’d want it out too!  It’s a nice color though.I was confused a lip on the amount of products too but thinking we all picked what we were comfortable panning 😅 good luck!!I like your product choices! You're a saint for trying to finish it despite the faulty packaging <33Walked into a trap 🤣🤣 this project is amazing!That is right, I suckered you in!! BAHAHAHAHAHA #sorrynotsorry OMG that shadow stick would drive me bonkers(er?)Just like I told Jessica...I knew y'all would be involved in this. Lol! I am terrified of cream products, but I know you will kill it! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaI must admit Amanda im at my desk in work and kind of teared a little. I've been watching your videos for a few years before i was brave enough to start my channel so to know that 1) you think my videos and DaLins are one of your favourites and2) you joined is beyond a compliment. Thank you so much genuinely and i cannot wait to follow along. Im so happy Jessica did that haha. TJMaxx😂😂😂Hey Amanda! Thank you for joining the fun (thanks Jessica :))! I am so excited! Also, I have never seen someone try to pan an eyeliner like that, so I am super curious!Yay! Good luck!Good luck! I will try to film and upload my intro today :)So liquid lips and concelears.. I can follow at home.. Jessica has the link to spreadsheet in her box.Your absolutely nuts!I have to refilm my intro.  I deleted the video on accident tonight!Great product choices as always ! U always aim high and actually achieve them👏🏼Hi new here 🔔🔔
You are lovely in purple shadows
I ALMOST put my cruella highlight in this project but I didnt 😐
I'm hoping to roll it in though 😊
I also got the Hades set bc it was gorgy plus! wow what a soundtrack 🎶🎵🎶🎵💃🏽💃🏽
Good luck 🍀🍀Good luck! That lipstick is going to be a challenge but I'm sure you will be able to finish it :)I’m happy that you’re doing this project as well. Can’t wait to see your progress! I wish you the best of luck with your products! 💗It is amazing how big this collab has gotten!! Great product picks!Your eyeshadow is so pretty! 😘 Purple is such a good color on you! That ColourPop shadow is so pretty! Good luck with everything!I started weighing in ounces and will probably skip to grams next month because it makes more sense! 😊 Sea Siren is so pretty, good luck!I am excited to watch everyones progress through the yearI have Sea Siren, too and LOVE it. And how funny, I chose a Colourpop Villain highlighter for my project, too!I love Hercules too. Im so happy for you having the scales. The products you chose are exciting.I have a Stila glitter too! 🙌🏼😅 looking forward to to your updates my vid will be up soon 😊You picked some beautiful products! I also will put my sea siren in later this year! Thanks so much for joining!Good luck on this project xxI love the eyeshadows you are panning in this project!  So glad to meet you! I have joined your YouTube family and I am doing this along with you!  Take care LoriI have another project going on until Feb 14th, so those products are taking priority at the moment.  I've only used 3 of my 5 products and each only once! I hope you're doing  better!wow such nice products. I love that highlighter. Yer very pretty 👍🏻You chose some great products. I love the silver eyeshadow. Good luck with your products!I'm the same with bright makeup! I'm comfortable wearing bold lips to work with neutral eye look, but I feel colorful eyeshadow is a bit too much for me to wear to work. Good luck! :)Oh those lipstick shades must look so pretty on you! You've got really great products! I really love that silver shadow as your inner corner highlight.You are not alone 🧡Hey gorgeous lady!!! Those cream shadows look stunning on you!!!I forgot about having a cream shadow! Hopefully it’s not dried out 😅 good luck on this 😊Could you pat a tiny amount of the silver in the middle of your bottom lip over cooler toned lipsticks to add a little highlight there?I think setting number of use goals is a great idea, I do the same. That silver shadow is beautiful and looks great on you. Good luck!Yay! Now I comment! I was wondering if the silver shadow could serve as a base for other more neutral shadows on work days. It might be a complete fail, but it would be something I might try! I'm so excited for your picks, and I'm soooo glad that you have joined us!Hi dearBest of luck on your products, and I love the lights in your background! I'm including liquid lipsticks in my project, too :)Thank you so much for joining. I am so so soo happy. 30 uses is great. With the revolution shadows you could put them on the lower lash line❤wow seeing pan on every shade in the lip palette is definitely satisfying to see even for a viewer! great product choices.

Thanks for tagging me in the bio, it’s much appreciated 🥰  i have the shanxo palette but have never used the lip side!Yay! I can’t wait to see your progress with the lipsticks in the palette.

I'm sure that highlighter won't be too difficult to hit pan on :)I love the packaging on the highlighter!! Good luck!This project scares me bc I am terrified of cream products! I think you will do great tho!

But I'm sure you'll be able to finish it quickly :)Good luck to you!! You picked some good products!The ladies did a great job getting this group together.  I'm enjoying finding other panners to watch. That lipstick is very pretty. So happy to be a part of this collab with so many amazing panners!That ColourPop shade is so pretty. I'm sad because I think they've discontinued that shade. That's a great idea to throw in that primer and foundation so you can get them out of your life! I've never used up a lipstick and y'all are showing me just how long they last! Good luck with everything!I always appreciate your energy. Thanks for your enthusiastic intro for this project and good luck. And yes, panning a 💄 is HARD!Jocelyn, I just have to say how lovely you look in this video. I’m loving the purples!!

Good luck!Lipsticks are the death of me and I own too many 🤦🏻‍♀️😂 so happy to see you part of this project. Yay!!Lipsticks take me forever to hit pan, too! Best of luck! <3Can’t wait to see your first update!! I think lipstick difficulty depends on their formula! I’m working on a Nars lipstick but it’s their old formula and it’s going fairly quickly..although I rarely use anything else so that might have something to do with it hahah good luck!!Such a cute name for the project, good luck on everything.  Love you eye look btw.Cant wait to see all the updates!Yayyyy!!! 💕💕Koosh is so pretty!! I’ll be rotating my sss but in my year long as I pan them good luck on this project 😊I really really love this idea - it's super cool that you're focusing on only cream products :) I'm just doing a regular project pan on my channel, but the rolling idea is super awesome!

Thank you so much and i cannot wait. I am excited to follow along. I am hopeful for that elf bronzer so that the whole palette is gone.How do you like the cream products from elf?

They seem so needy and loveable.Such a fun one! I like this idea! I think I’m going to add into this!Yay Rebeca! I love that I’m in another project with you. Im rubbing elbows with royalty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Love ur puppy’s tail... I call all dogs puppy’s 😛The Balm lipstick is surprisingly intense! Usually the formulas in a pan are more sheer but that is properly BAM! Great products. I forgot to put a lipstick in mine. Silly!Where's your 2019 all year long makeup empties? :(Looking forward to the updates! Thinking I might need join this project over on Instragram...😏Your makeup looks really nice. I love the red. Good luck with the project. You picked some good things.I am sooo excited tha you joined! I secretly geek out over your content!

Thanks so much for joining!Thumbs up for lipstick on my teeth. If you are new this is a common occurrence in my life. Oh well...life goes on 🤪🤪😂😂😂Loved finding your channel !!

I hope you can finish the eyeliner quickly :)That purple eyeshadow is so beautiful one you! Love how ambitious you are in your choices! I can’t wait for your updates girl! ❤️❤️Oh eyeliners are such a good idea to throw in here. That lipgloss is gorgeous. I feel you on the struggle to pan a lipstick! That's a great idea to rotate through your blushes seasonally.Very excited to see you join and to see your progress. Smart to rotate the nars blushes.
Good luck 🍀🍀🍀🍀You picked some great products! 😁I’m hoping you get to finish the Nars gloss. Also, I love that you are putting in full sized lip products! I hope you kick their theoretical butts😂❤️I’m trying to use up a liquid blush as well. I love the idea of rotating products out by season. Good luck!Good luck on your choices! I’m picking out my items for this project tomorrow and filming real quick. 🥰So many people are doing this project!  Great idea to target cream products!  I’ve kind of been doing this on the side since 2019, targeting specific cream products to get them finished and out.  I like what you are doing with the Nars blush to get use of them all.  Can I say, I didn’t even notice lipstick on your teeth!  Lol!Really loved this intro! Can’t wait for the update..good luck!! ❤️Eyeliners are so hard for me to use up! I’m trying to use up a mini from Urban Decay
The Nars liquid blush is beautiful, I love how you’re going to switch them out every season
Can’t wait to see your progress!I think you’ll do great! So many nice gifts haha! 😃Good luck. Hopefully you can get some good use out of all those products.YAY Alex, I'm so excited to be in this project with you!! The lipstick on your teeth made me genuinely laugh out loud, I love it! <3oh ya it would be impossible to finish a whole Nars liquid blush, you only need a tiny dab and those are big bottles! Super beautiful blush though, good luck with the project!I'd be scared to own a liquid blush, but those are all really pretty.I need to work on some lip products so I may be joining.Ok so I think I may actually want to do this one. I hate the idea of cream stuff going bad!!Oooooh Yayyyy!!! I am so happy to be doing another project with you!! Very smart idea with the blush!!Sending good vibes to you! I so needed to do something like this last year! You’ll see in my year of makeup empties.Yeah! I’m also panning Dolce Vita in this project. Good luck and let the games begin! 🙌🏻Hi familia! So happy you’re joining us, Alex! 💕Can’t wait to see your progress 💖Yayee Alex! All the best! I posted my introduction video too today!Alex, you rock! You're awesome at panning and panning more then 1,2,3 etc. Since I'm just starting out with my yr project panning I don't want to get myself into a world win and fail plus I really don't want to have a panic attack. This one sounds like fun tho. I like how you'll be trading blushes as the season change. 
2020 is going to be a hard one to say because I had to write a check to the school and what did I do? I wrote 2019 and I keep saying it. It's usually not that hard. 🙄🙂
Have a fabulous weekend! 💕Good luck on this love that you’re rotating  the nars blushes great idea!!I am so happy you've joined Alex. Ive been watching you for so long so im super delighted. I can't wait to follow along. The butter highlight and the nars blush spoke to me.haha . Great goal ❤I love the rotation of the nars liquid blushes! You picked some beautiful products! That lip looks great on you! Thanks so much for joining Alex! I am sooo excited to collab with you!Idk what I was thinking saying 100 uses on the Chanel bronzer but we’ll do baby steps and say 50 uses is my goal for now that way I can kinda meet a goal 😅 thank you all for watching! 💖So excited to do this with you and finding your channel!!! Can’t wait for your updatesI would love to try the Chanel bronzer. It looks so stunning! I wish you the best of luck with your items. Can’t wait to see your progress! ☺️I'm so glad you joined in too! Good luck! That Chanel bronzer is going to be a challenge!Excited for your updates girl! I am glad you are doing this project!!!! ❤️❤️ you chose some challenging products! Get it girlfriend! 💪🏻Your eyelook is gorgeous. 😍 I love the Too Faced foundation! I had some success with rehydrating my Stila Glitter shadow with contact lense solution.100 uses would probably surprise you on how much you use!!! I hope you also get some good use on your Stila glitter and glow! Those are so hard for me to pan🙃🤣I decided to join in this project! Lol big goal for Chanel Bronzer. Girl good luck on thatYou picked some ambitious products, good luck!Sending you good vibes with that bronzer. Does the peach foundation have a strong scent? Does it go away after months of having the product??Queen of panning! I can't wait to see how the Chanel bronzer goes for you. I've always wanted to buy it but never did. I might need it huh lolI love all the goals you’ve been setting recently, you go girl 🥳I've always wanted to try the Chanel cream bronzer. Argh!! My Stila mini glitters are starting to dry out too. 😩Your makeup looks so pretty! 
I love this project idea. Can’t wait to see your progress 
I’ve seen the Chanel bronzer sooo many times on YouTube, I really want to try it in the Summer time 
My Stila glitters just sit in my drawer as well. They’re so beautiful, idk why I don’t use them more oftenYour eye makeup looks lovely! Good to see you doing this #partnersincream project pan !I love your eyeshadow look! And I like the idea of trying to use something a # of times instead of hitting pan. I'm doing that for some of my products as well.The Toofaced primer and foundation will used up less than 6 months , good luck lovely!I have heard such good things about all those. I have the foundation and love it along with my stiles so hopefully where they are good products it will help you get through itYou are so so beautiful, Mariela! I am so excited to watch all of you Ladies' progress! I am terrified of cream products. Lol! TFS! ~ NonaSince I'm on a super low buy I'm going to be panning all my cream products too so they don't go bad! I don't think it'll be too hard, for cream base makeup I literally have 2 cream blushes and 2 cream bronzers and 1 cream highlight so it's not too much. I should do good on those :)❤️❤️This is such a fun project..Giving cream products priority makes so much sense. Can’t wait to see your progress!!Definitely joining this one as well as the 2020You are brave to try to use that Chanel bronzer. I wanted to buy that about 5 years ago and am so glad I didn’t. That sucker is massive!!!🙈🙈You can never do too many panning projects!  lol I am totally the same way, if it isn't in a project I don't use it.  You chose some great products to work on.I’m so intrigued by this project and want to do it too!!I love watching your videos a lot you show a lot of must try products for me 🙏🏻I am so excited that we are doing another project together!!!I love your eyemakeup in this video!Such an amazing idea! Let me know when you do another project pan!brilliant video! 🤍🖤HAHA WAS THAT ME ABOUT THE CHANEL BRONZER? I’ve literally had it in a year long project for 2 years in a row and nada in regards to pan 😂 maybe 3rd times a charm?Wow! Teint de Chanel will be a challenge! Good luck on this project!So excited to see you joining us! 💕Lol the project name is super cute! & yesss Im the same way. If it’s not in a project, everything just sits there😬 & im not one to use the same products every single day unless it’s like foundation, concealer and powder. LolI just repurchased  the TF peach Matt primer in the smaller size I love it and I have dry skin I do use 2 different primers though a hydrating and a smoothing one.I need to use my stila shimmer and glitter and glows more often I hardly ever use them.Love watching your videos

Love your eyeshadow!Eye Candy is beautiful. I didn’t know about the bump in the middle of the super shock shadows so now my goal is to wear them down evenly as well. Good luck with your products!It is smart to start with an easy product like that primer. Oh that highlighter is very pretty. I love that you are going to try to use your SSS evenly to hit pan.  Good luck!Sss and Stila glitters seem to be the product picked in this project yay for doing a project together 😊Oh how exciting! Good luck! :DBrilliant video Sofie. I am so delighted you wanted to join. I can't wait to follow along. The supershocks are being attacked this year😂Yay Sofie! You’re joining us! 💕Hej! That highlight palette has always tempted me! I am so excited to be watching you work on this project with you! I think I will also have a colourpop shadow in this project the entire time! Thanks for signing up!I'm really glad you swatched those super shocks because now I have a better idea of what they look like! I only have Birthday Wish, & I'm currently on a No-Buy, but I know what I want to get when it's over!I love the products you've chosen! I wish you the best of luck! :)I think it's a good idea to do this in a way you are doing it! I personally don't have any cream or liquid shadows but if I had, I would probably do something similar :)What a fun project pan! I can’t wait to see what eye looks you come up with. I think how you’re structuring the project is going to help you try out a ton of cream products in your collection. I’m excited to see your progress. xoxo kmp 💋Wow! I love the colors you chose. I hope u keep them.Very exciting to collaborate with you on this project!!  Good luck!!Ohhh snap. This will be a challenge but so rewarding!Good luck on the project!!I styled one of my projects like this last year (where I put things in to decide if I wanted to keep them) and found it was a good way to clean up my collection. I love this idea! The products you picked are beautiful.I think all of those shadows are beautiful. Happy to be collabing with so many great panners!I love how we are all approaching this project differently. Your hand was beautifully adorned by the end of the video with all those SSSs! 😍 I look forward to hearing your thoughts on them next month. 🤓I love the products you choose! I already filmed my intro I just have to edit and upload it!When wear silver on the lid I like to put matte greys, cool tone browns, mauves, lilacs, or berry colors into the crease. I feel those all pair very well with silver tones. Each different matte will make the silver look slightly different tone depending on what you choose to pair it with.I love your spin on this!!!Tons of shadows so many pretty colors that will look pretty with your eyes!This project sounds like a lot of fun! I know you’ll do great!Looking forward to your update to see what kind of progress you make on those Colourpop items. Good luck!I am absolutely thrilled that you joined. Thrilled. Yes you can  use lipsticks too, i know with your chopping block it could work :) What a great use of this project. I actually love the products you chose. I cant wait to see your update and thank you so much.All the colors are so pretty that you chose.How fun! I think I will join on instagram since I don't make videos
IG @makeupby_amandaraeI love how you have made this project your own! It's very smart! I am very excited that you joined, and I look forward to your 1st update!your makeup looks beautiful🥰I am similar to you. If I use a glitter, I kind of want an opaque one. I never remember to reach for a topper!So excited to do this project with you. I feel the same way about cp sss ! Feel like I always buy more and never finish because they dry out too fast for meI’m feeling you on not wanting to finish loved cream products like my charlotte tilbury contour and highlight wants. Also that lipstick color is stunning! I hope to hop on the bandwagon soon💖You look absolutely stunning! I love that lipcolour you’re wearing. I wish you the best of luck on your products! Can’t wait to see your progress! 💗I'd love it if you would put your makeup details in the description 😊That Super Shock is super pretty! I actually don't have any Super Shocks left. I had the Kathleen Lights Where The Light Is Duo but was really confused with the formula. Especially the mattes I found really difficult to use. The shade Kathleenlights I loved, it was a beautiful metallic shade. But then there was a weird glittery bronze that wasn't pigmented at all. Good luck with this project! :)Is it me or the colourpop super shock shadow are really easy to hit pan on? I used mine 2 times and I hit pan in the center 🤔😱Your eyeshadow look is so pretty!! Can't wait to see your progress on all these project pans!Wait... your eyeliner.... I need details. I love itLipsticks are super hard to pan! I tried panning a nyx soft matte lip cream last year and legit used it almost every day but still have half left!! Woooh😥 Good luck on yours!Your skin always looks amazing! Today is no exception! I can’t wait to see your next update!! ❤️Nice to discover your channel through this project. I’m panning a lot of lipstick this year too (in a different project). The struggle is real, especially since your L’Oréal looks practically brand new!This is good. I have used a couple cream products under my project pan items. 😂 I don't want them to go bad.Good luck with all the items, but like dang you and cream cheek products, I just know that’s gonna work out.I feel like I’m the only person who hasn’t tried anything from color popWhat is your lip color? I love it!I LOVE the joah bb cream!!! I’ve been feeling that I’m the only one... but looks like not the case 😆 I also love using beauty bakerie wake and bake oil first underneath the joah bb!!!Are you going to be using the scale on this one too?How tf do you do so many projects at once??? I have only one 'big'  project pan at the moment. My other projects are just like "use x product y number of times by z date"HAHAHAHA I think we are all over eager at the beginning of the year. Oh that blush is pretty. Great product picks for this project, happy to be doing this collab together!You did get me hyped! Let’s do this!Are you going to be doing the graveyard project pan again this year?I use the Lunch Money super shock highlight under my foundation almost every day for a radiant glowI am mildly embarrassed that I had to look up what dgaf means. Good luck!!Everyone is so ambitious and here I am like I may pan a eyeshadow or two lol.  I totally think you can do the SSS!What a great idea!! I'm definitely gonna do on instaThis is a great project idea!!I have DGAF in one of my projects as well and 've actually been able to use it as a blush topper! Keep in mind I am more warm/olive tone and I am dry as heck so I like glossy and sparkly stuff...but could be worth investigating!Instead of decluttering the dry supershocks check videos of people reviving them so hopefully you can save them❤Yay Christina i am so so happy you decided to join. Thank you so so soooooo much. I cannot wait to see how you do. I think you'll do well with that blush. The supershocks look stunning.❤Im obsessed with how your eyeliner looks! This is a fun project pan!Lol 5 must be your favorite number.
When you went to swatch that lipstick all the way up I about died. I was about to come through the screen. :)I'm so excited to do this project together!Yay!I’m trying to do a project pan but a lot of my makeup isn’t mashing with my skin 😫 my cheeks are super dry than the rest of my face a lot of the makeup I own is for oily skin and I don’t want to spend the money for dry skin products. Do you have any recommendations ?Your eyeliner is the bomb diggity!!! Also, good luck with that highlight, I chose to put in a hair care products.. what I didn't say is that I am having my husband use it too >PPPI'm so excited I am going to join in on instagram!Yayyyy!!!! I am so happy that we are doing another project together!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉Steph created it lol well looks like i will be joining because i love her!!! Lol let me pic my itemsI love to put my super shock highlights under my foundation! It helps me go through them quicker!I wish I could find a good drugstore cream blush (that wasn’t Colourpop). ☹️
Excited for this! ☺️Holy cow, a lipstick!!! I know you will kill it! I am so excited to follow along! Thank you soooooo much for joining!

Lunch Money is such a pretty shade!I feel like there should be a partner project called 'Powder Puff Girls.I am loving your eye makeup. You chose some great products! You have some great progress alreadyHi Paula! I looooove your hair color!!! 💜💜💜Awww I love this idea. I wish I knew this was kicking off cos I've inadvertently focused on cream products in my panning this year but the products are pepper potted across my projects. I'm using: cream foundation, cream colour correcting palette, cream blush, cream bronzer, cream highlight, (lots of) cream eyeshadows and even cream eyebrow product lol it would have been neat if they were all in the same project. Good luck with your products 😁 think you'll have a bunch of empties 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻Have fun at your holiday party!  A lot of people who I subscribe to are doing this project and it’s a great theme! I love cream products and some in my collection are older than others, and I have been focused on using up specific products. I will be happy to see some of them done!This is such a great idea!  I have a hard time wanting to use cream products, only because I don't like using brushes on cream products- they're harder to clean- but I think cream products actually look betterCan I come to your party? Lol my Xmas tree was taken down last weekend but it’s still inside my house cuz I need tape to tape the box to take it to storage 😅😅I'm doing this collab too! I wanted to try to participate in some group projects this year, & I love cream products & have several I need to get through in the next year or they're going bye-bye. My video is currently uploading, but I never know how long it'll take. I'm glad to see you're participating. If you weren't, I was going to invite you, but I know you & Jessica Lee do several projects together, & she's participating, so I should've realized you would've been invited too. LolI’m excited to watch this project!  Good luck 🍀👍🏼This is the perfect project for you to use up both of those Elf palettes. Lol! Best of luck in hitting your goals! Love ya!

Lol and I Love my cream products too!!The Eastern Orthodox Church doesn't celebrate Epiphany until January 19th, so technically it's still Christmas.Hi Paula!

I don’t have a lot of cream items either which is good!This project is so scary to me. Lol! I am terrified of cream products. Good luck meeting your goals, Gorgeous! TFS! ~ NonaI forget to use cream contour all the time until it's too late.  I was going to suggest if the contour shades are too dark, maybe mix it with the light highlighter shade to get them to the right color?You could use that cream color from the elf palette as an eyeshadow base.For the color that is too tan for you, you can always put it under your foundation to make it lighter ❤👍Love this.  I saw kailee tooI am so excited that we are getting to do this project together!! 🎉🎉🎉 I cannot wait to see your progress!!!love this! 😌✨I love your picks! I am really glad that you were able to make this project work for you! I am soooo excited to be panning with you! Thanks so much for joining!Yaaay Katariina I am so happy. Are we in your new house right now ?:O I LOVE that you put that palette in. Thank you so so so much, you really have made me so happy. Best of luck. You're video is in the playlist now.Oh my god! Your hair 😍So excited to do this project with you ! Can’t wait to see the rest of ur updatesI’ve never used a supershock highlighter. I had wisp a long time ago but it was too dark for me. BUT I got a ‘velour highlighter’ from shopmissa.com in the shade 4u, it’s in a project pan. But I’m almost done with it. There’s not a ton of product (3.1g) but it’s seriously so so beautiful & it’s only $1!! & it’s cruelty free! I got it last year and I got a few other shades too but this is by far my favorite. The only one I kept actually. It’s the softest gold highlighter that is perfect for days I’m not wearing makeup but still want that glow effect. It’s so beautiful! I have swatches of it on IG.. jnicole1119, in case you want to check it out. There’s no glitter or anything. It’s just SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOOOOOO beautiful!! & the back says it’s good for 12m which is pretty good for more of a creamy producti just saw your end of the year makeup empties and now im watching all of your videos !! im so excited to see all of your updates ! i am doing a project pan on my channel as well so i am always searching for others to support ahaI’m sorry that it took me forever to watch your video... 
But first of all: your hair looks stunning! It looks so healthy. 
And second I love the products you’ve chosen. I wish you the best of luck and I can’t wait to see your update! 💗I love your hair color ☺️☺️ i used to always contour and cream highlight everyday but then i got lazy 😫 i’m tempted to buy the flower beauty liquid blush!Those liquid lipsticks are so pretty! And the shade you're wearing in this video looks beautiful on you.Yay for spf!!!! Great picks and I'm loving this lip on you. Super pretty 
👍🏼👍🏼👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🎈
🔔🔔🔔I am in love with your hair! 😍 I rarely use lip scrubs and have 2 in my collection that I need to use up!I love your hair. You picked some good things. Good luck.What a good idea for a project!

You inspired me once more.Yay so excited to do this project together!
I also put a lip product in my project and my goal is to use it 20 times.Definitely joining but on IG. @panning246 is my page. I hope you take a look and maybe follow. Good luck to you and all that are participating.Great project! I’m sure you will do great as usual!Your hair color looks so amazingly beautiful on you!!!!! 😍Thank you so so much for joining Tash. Its such a compliment. I can't wait to see how you do particularly with supershock highlighter. Best of luck and thank you.Ok. First, love the new hair colour. Next, what an amazing array of products. You make me want to use my ABH liquid lipsticks. And a lip scrub? Great combo with the lipsticks too.Your eyelook is simply amazing😍 Good luck with your projectOh, and the eyebrows match your hair (it wasn't that visible in the vlog) 🤩Love your hair colour :)I loved the items you picked. I am so excited to see how often you use those liquid lips. I am not good at lip products in general, so I'm pumped for this! Thanks so much for joining! I'm so excited to be panning with you in this project!Your hair looks amazing 😍Love your hair!I know you will be one of the most successful @ this project, Tash! I am terrified of cream products. Lol! Love you! TFS! ~ NonaOh, girl! Your hair is gorgeous!!! I love it!I have the flower beauty blush bombs in pinched and bubbly as well, and I love mixing them together! It creates a really beautiful peachy pink that I find more flattering than either shade on it's own. 😊Great picks looking forward to your updates ☺️Oh that Maleficent packaging is super pretty. I love that you have 2 highlighters in but use them in very different ways.The way I fly through my spf is I measure a quarter teaspoon for my face alone.  I apply another quarter teaspoon on my neck and ears.  I even put some on the back of my hands.  Once you get the hang of it, it doesn’t take long.  Sometimes I pre-measure it the night before and put it in a small container.  I sometimes mix sunscreen to make the perfect shade.Wow! Natasha! You look stunning with your new hair 😎😍😍😍.You picked some challenging products but you can do it! Also your hair looks fantastic!I’m excited to see your update!!I love this brighter hair color on you!I love the lights on your background too! And all the best for the liquid lipsticks! The SPF is a good idea. I should incorporate one in some project of mine too ❤️❤️Good luck! I am seeing a lot of Super Shock items in these intros 😃I keep my lip scrubs in the shower. It’s easy to use that way!I love the new hair color. It looks soooo good on you!!Your eye makeup looks fab 😊. Good luck with this Project!Could you add some vanilla essence or similar to the scrub to make it less playdoh like? You would only need a drop, and the essences you use in baking are long lasting so they wouldn't alter the shelf life of the scrub.so many projects this morning! I'm loving it.I am in love with your red hair!! 😍😍So happy you are doing this project as well!! Great choices. 😁😁This sounds like a fun project!  I actually have been loving cream products lately.Yesss, I struggle with cream products xGreat product choices the buxom gloss is beautiful.You got a new subscriber.

I love your project pans!I got an allergic reaction to one of my concealers that was very old so I tossed the ones that were very old cause I didn’t want that to happen again! This is why I stoped buying makeup because I can’t use up everything with in time and it’s just a waste of money tossing it awayGood luck on panning your products. I'm planning a Lipstick too and....man am I worried 😅I’m not even going to lie I was wondering where your video was cause I knew you had to have joined this project as well. So excited!! I have added a liquid blush too and I only own 4 (didn’t buy them) so I am rotating one for each season. We both will be tortured with using them 😂😂 and I panned no angel mini by Marc Jacobs last year. 6 months!! Yup 🤦🏻‍♀️Ao excites you're doing this project pan 🦄🦄
I also added a product to this project pan that I needed encouragement to finish. It's an elf concealer and I'm barely into it😄😄😄
Good luck🍀🍀🍀🍀Try the flower beauty blush under your foundation!I thought of buying the flower beauty cream blush in pinched but I can just use up lipsticks as cream blush 😅 good luck on your picks! 😊I think you could get away with using the flower beauty blush every single day under whatever other blush you want to use.

Can't wait to see how it goes! And you are funny!Yay! Good luck! I’m really growing to like cream products moreFun .I am excited tooAre friends on insta? Girl, I hope so!! Waking up at 530 is no joke! I was waking up at 430 and I literally needed a nap everyday 😂😂Yayyy Victoria!! 💜💜💜💜I love cream products too!!! I think it makes me look younger. My skin always look so much better with cream productsYou’re killing the abh stick foundation ! I have that in my 20 in 2020 Project Pan and I’m strugglingggg ! But you are def the queen of panning so I’m not surprised xxThank you so much for doing this ❤i think you'll have the milk product finished by next time.I think you did great! Keep on going!!Oh, you look great, that lipstick suits you very well!You've made some good progress! I'm doing this project as well. I'm amazed at how much you go through! Can't wait to follow your progress.So fun to see you expand the pan on Vanilly!Oh my!! You have been doing so well!!! 😍😍😍Wow good progress on all your products.I love your makeup look in this video! Great update! The Elf Foundation palette will be gone in no time. I have the Elf Cream Contour Palette and my progress is super slowWoohoo! Always amazing progress. Love seeing your kids roam around living their best life 😂As always, great progress!I love seeing your dogs!! 💕And in the background... dogs doing what dogs do. ;) :p Great update! You made some good progress! :DAMazing!!!Your channel is so inspiring!Wow you made amazing progress on the milk highlighter!Would love to see in the next update how depressing the lipstick looked good job 👏🏼👏🏼I have that highlighter in one of my projects but I'm just not reaching for itLove that lipstick on you!Really great progress!You are really the panning queen! Great progressAre you doing this project?❤Oh my goodness, just came from your finale. You did AMAZING!!You are so pretty. I have a “few” jelly much and I regret buying them as I have yet to wear any of the,  I swatch them, just don’t wear. 😬. Lyay to rolling in a new product! have to admit love rosy looks on you! and its so devastating seeing a product go bad!Girl, just reacting to send some love. 
The cream highlight palette is stunning!Many years ago, I had a drugstore eyeshadow quad that I had an allergic reaction to, but being young, I didn’t immediately put two and two together and I probably used it another couple days and my eyelids got swollen and scaly and uncomfortable.  Yuck.  On a different topic, I am doing this project on my own (not filming).  I am trying to use two Mary Kay cream shadows 10X each, plus I want to use up the Super Shock blush in Prenup and the Super Shock highlighter in On The Cusp.  The two SS products look very natural on me, so I can really pile them on, which helps get some progress.  I would also like to hit pan in a SS shadow, probably Wattles. Again, very natural color and easy to pile on.  Would also like to get some more use out of my Stila glitter & glows too.I think I may have to set a different goal on my STILA liquid shadow.  I don’t want to wear glitter on my eyes every day😂.  I’m sorry about the swollen eye😫.  Cream products do go quicker!I am also silently participating in your project, I’m really excited to use up my cream products, thanks for this solid idea! Sending love your way ❤️I am so excited about how much traction this project is getting!!  I am so happy to see such success!Oh no 😓 a reaction is scary!!That reaction sounds scary! I'm glad your lid got back to normal the next day.Love your eyeshadow look! So beautiful and it’s perfect for Valentine’s Day!😍💕👌🏻 Hope to stay connected!💛I got involved in a project pan for this year and I reacted terribly to one of the products, which left me not wearing makeup until the hives all went away. It was gross 🤢
Side note...love all things cream based. I think I'm in the minority with that sentiment but LOVES ME SOME CREAMS.You’re doing really well! I picked up a scale that weighs decimals just for panning lol. I found it discouraging when I use a product a ton and there’s no change in the weightOh no! I haven’t gotten a reaction yet but I also do make sure I don’t keep creams and liquids long for this reason. I need my eyeballs 😂😂 that highlighter you rolled in looks amazing.Well done! Awful that you got a reaction, but at least now you can focus on other products before they get to the same point and move them out 😊Oh no! I am so sad that the product went bad and cause a reaction!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉I got a Jelly Much shadow for Christmas, you make me realize I need to start working on it. OMG I can't believe you had a reaction.  Anything with eyes is scary business.  Glad you are ok!!!I think those looks are still fine for the office. Although I’m always scared to overdo it as well ;) really like them though! Definitely a good reason why sooo many people are doing this project. As much as a lot of our products can last for years, some of them just won’t. I finally filmed my intro. It will be going up on Wednesday.Congrats on all the progress!watching and drinking my morning coffee! It was great getting to hang out with you. 😊i recently saw the beauty news channel do a video on reviving dried up CP super shock eyeshadows and the best product was the inglot duraline.  im considering purchasing it for these types of situations especially when the product isnt even old/hit its expiration date!That Colourpop Jelly eyeshadow looks spectacular on you. Glad you are getting use from it before it dried up completely. Nervous about my Maybelline color tattoos now. Swollen eyelids- Yikes!I totally forgot about lip liners! I may have to include one at some point. Well done!😃I loved the udpate! Good luck for next month Steph! <3Yay A Steph video!!!🎉🎉Sorry about your eye reaction. I am susceptible to those and have to be careful. Smart of you to throw it straight away into the trash. Don’t mess around with eye issues!!Oh no! So concerning about the colour tattoo..I use mine every day (and I have more of them collecting dust in my collection) hopefully I don’t get a similar reaction..it’s a risk we take on I suppose. Throwing it out when it does seem to perform fine just doesn’t seem right either. It’s hard! Anyways, I loved the update!! Thanks for sharing 😁❤️So happy to have helped add yet more reds to your collection. 😅 You look like you’re having fun with this project. Thanks to both of you for creating it. Can’t wait to film & upload my update later today. 🤓I had taken out a product from my year long project because it was bad gave me a slight rash and smelt like alcohol bye bye lol but nice update mine will be live in the morning 😊Your lippie is gorgeous! I am so excited for you & DaLin that your project took off so well! WOW! Over 70 ppl now. That is amazing! Sorry, you had a reaction. That is scary. TFS! ~ NonaWhat the what?! 30 eyeshadows?! Did I hear that right? Oh! I pan looks too! Those red toned shades are gorgeous on you. 😘 That Jelly Much shadow definitely looks so dry, so I'm happy you're still able to use it. The swatch was lovely though. 

Omg. That's terrifying that you had a reaction to that eye product! I'm so glad it wasn't a long term issue for you. 

The Huda palette! I don't know why, but I love seeing you use that thing. 🙃 Is that weird? 

You're doing amazing lovely! Good luck with this month! 🍀💕That is so scary that you had that reaction!Wow that red jelly shade is stunning on you!The sss is beautiful! And love your eye look! Great progress  xxThanks for stopping by my channel! I came over to return the love & subscribed. You are so pretty! I love your dark hair. Congrats on getting to roll in a new product. TFS! ~ NonaLOVE your eyeshadow look!😍💕 Perfect for Valentine’s Day too! Hope to stay connected!💛I'm updating on IG. If anyone wants to follow my IG is Inthebeautymix and tag me on your project pans so I can follow ! Love the pink look today.Good job finishing that item. I wish you the best of luck for the next month!I absolutely love the products you chose. The supershock shadow is stunning. You've gotten some great use out of your products. Your makeup is stunning. I think you'll do well on the mac liner. Thank you so so much for joining. Your video is in the playlist ❤ i also subscribed 😊Nice update I’m doing this project too! Will be up in the morning 😊Great video! Very detailed I like it 💜Great update! Rolling in items is always so fun! That ulta highlight is so pretty!That bronzer is tempting me hard! One day I will pick it up! It looks like you get a ton of product! Great picks Emelie!you can always tell if a product has an airless pump if it has a small hole in the bottom of the packaging. This allows the air to get it. Good job so far on your project!!Wow you made some really good progress great job! XxThanks for sharing your progress. It doesn’t matter how much your scale costs all you need to do is calibrated it looks like your scale hasn’t been calibrated just look online and see how they calibrated scale. That should help you a lotHi there new here! 🔔 i I think you chose great products the kitten Karma and the spotlight highlighter are so pretty and I love that you're using the highlighter under your foundation what a great idea good luck can't wait to see your next update🎈🐧I finished up a mini base tape last year and really enjoyed it! Super hydrating! Great job on the cream blushes 😊The progress on that blush palette is seriously impressive!! 🎉🎉💕hope you alright :) go make-up I need some of that to cover my bag under my eyes:(You did great! Good luck for the next month! ☺️I love this look!😍💕 Hope to stay connected!💛Oh girl I am right there with you on the dog hair thing!!!  lol WOAH look at the side pan in Cobbler!!  BAHAHAHAHA I love that disclaimer "you make your own choices, you're an adult"Rolling your glitters in and out with usage goals is super smart! I wish I would have done that instead of my usage goal up of using to a certain point!Very good progress! I also love to use cream blush and bronzer under my foundation. It typically means I use less foundation, which helps my skin look a little less old because it isn't weighed down!Love the title animation! So cool!Wow that's really good progress with those cream blushes! And congrats on finishing the lip mask! :)My mini stila always dry out before my full size :(cracking up at your intro dog hair freak out 😂😂


you literally are a blush panning queen - I can't get over how you hit pan in a powder AND are using not one, but 2 cream blushes so flipping well!


When any of your Stila shimmers end up drying out, I'd love to see a video on how you create your DIY super shock shadow 😊😊😊Awwww thank you so much. You are so so lovely. I really am so happy you are doing this. Your progress on the balm palette is amazing. You'll definitely finish it. Im curious about your thoughts on the tarte face primer. ❤Rotating the stops is a great idea! This shade is super pretty too!!I am so happy that the blush under your foundation helps!! 🎉🎉🎉FIRST!! oh my, my life is covered in dog hair🤣I appreciate you putting pictures from the intro xx good luck for the upcoming months 😊Hello!! Well done! I’ve heard such good things about the milk bronzer!Very nice! This project being a yr long def helped me decide to participate.  I tend to do other project pans and 1yr means I have time to put this project on hold to work on my others, BONUS💥💥💥💥
New here 🔔🔔🔔💗🔔🔔🔔It makes sense that you'd use that blush a little more than the highlight! 10 times seems like a good goal to shoot for by the next update! Well done!Well done Sarah Jane👏👏 i love the products you have in here. The colourpop stick looks so pretty. Your video is in the playlist 😊 thank you soOoooo much for joining. I think 10 times is a good goal.I had to leave and come back! I cannot wait to see all of your progress!!! 🎉🎉Thank you so so much. I am so happy that you're doing this. I love your top. Its stunning. Could you use the green nail polish on your toes? Thats a great tip with the face primer. I will try it. Also, i loved Dexters laboratories. Im singing the theme song here haha.Oh my!!!

Great update!You top is sooooo cute! 😍I wish I could have your curls they’re beautiful ! Great update Jessica xxExcellent progress and choice of products! I been wanting to try the CP gel liners bc I tend to have issues with liner showing up on my waterlines. I also have a cream elf palette I'm thinking about rolling in eventually...its blue 👀🙄😄😄I started this project today 😊Girl!! Your hair looks stunning in this video, not that I’m biased with curly hair or anything, hahaYou are doing great. You sound better. So glad you are feeling better. Winter is almost over.Wow, a lot of people are doing this project!  I am focused on some older cream products too.  I am hoping that a cream blush is done next month.  Who knows though!  I’m mixing it with a cream highlighter every day when I apply it and it has become a really pretty glowy blush!I am also not the most delicate of flowers. Lol I am a disaster perpetually happening, so I drop & break things all the time.Concealer is so hard to use up.  Sounds like you don't usually use concealer, either.  lol  But you're rocking it!Your hair is amazing today.Funny you mentioned that #momlife 😅 literally watching this update while I put my face on... at 1pm 😂💕Hair goals!!! I love this community so much! I have been very curious about the colourpop liners, so I am glad to hear that they are worth it! You made me giggle so much in this video! Also, I feel you about some products giving you lines you never knew you had! LOL Great update!!!you are doing so well! love your nail polish also!Brilliant that you give yourself mini goals which are achievable and motivating 👍🏼Well done Jessica you did so well already. I love your goals. Thank you so much for your kind words. I really appreciate it. Your video is in the playlist ❤I love the eyeliner from Colourpop and ohh the purple color that you have in this projectI love that you set little mini goals for yourself with your projects. You have done some work on your items! 🎉If you add in all of the people doing the project at home, and not really saying anything about it... I bet that number gets really high! I am doing this one myselfI think I’m saying dalin name wrong 🤷🏻‍♀️ lol I was having second thoughts if we were suppose to upload but good thing you did lol mine will be live in the morning 😊 good job so far! Slow and steady wins the race 💖This project stresses me out bc of all of the cream & liquid products. Lol! Love you! TFS! ~ NonaHi Jessica, I have a question : can you put a product in different challenges? For my 3 projects I put différents items, but it s only 3 lol... Take care SophieGreat job on your progress!Hitting pan is still a big goal for that black shade! I totally understand wanting to shift your goal some! Good update!Well done Tabitha you've made great progress. Your video is in the playlist. Thank you so so much for joining. Im delighted. I think hitting pan in the black glitter primer is really a great goal. ❤You picked some really nice products! That contour stick and the orange shade from The Balm palette are sooo pretty!I am so sorry that I found this so late! I am so excited that you are joining!I am so so so happy you joined❤❤thank you so much. Looking forward to watching your update. This video is in playlist too.

I such @ using cream products. TFS! ~ NonaGood luck on the project dear!Yay so happy you are joining this project!The balm has a set of those luminizers I think 4 colors in it, I bought it at Ross for 5.99 and I don't like it at all compared to the becca one I use everyday and I actually did what u do I have the big pump and I refill the mini with the doe foot I really like doing it that way.I need to do something like this cause I got all this makeup and always reach for my favorites and neglect everything else.Those CP colorshock shadows look so pretty I don't have any of them😞Once I clicked on the thumbnail and saw the onesie I got so excited again hahaha ! Great update xxOhhh your Tom Ford blush and Perky look really pretty! Good luck! 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
New here 🔔🔔🔔🔔💘Hello! I am new to your channel! I love panning videos so I am trying to watch & subscribe to everyone in this project. You are making good progress. I look forward to watching more of your videos. I do beauty content as well if you would be interested. TFS! ~ NonaYou did great!! 💝💝🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉I applaud you for digging that bronzer out! Very good update!Well done👏👏i am so happy you're doing this. My favourite products are you blush and bronzer. Absolutely beautiful. Your video is in the playlist❤‘I think it will be fine ‘ me at every product I drop lol❤️I have a NARS Claudia lipstick with about the same amount in it as yours (b4 that wretched fall!!😫😫) and it's been hanging around for a while now lol, may need to put it in this project
Congrats on rolling 2 out!Great update as always! Sometimes I use my stilas as a cut crease primer.I don't think I own a single cream face product except my elf poreless putty primer. I just don't like using them. They feel so heavy on my skin. 😬I didn’t know the Stila shadows have a 12 month shelf life.  Mine are about 2 years old... oopsIf the lipstick hits the floor and gets squished with dust and goobies, it’s done.  Your health is worth more and the 30 second rule is a fallacy.  You haven’t failed your project, just consider it done and move onto the next product in that category.Try putting the lip in the fridge!you're doing so so good omg! i'm doing a project pan this year but i need to throw in more creams so they don't go badThat lipstick is gonna be done so soon! Good save lol . I need to put my liquid eyeshadows in a  project too XDGreat job. I almost cried for you when the lipstick fell. Great saveFreeze the lipstick. Rolled down. It will reset itYou have made AMAZING progress already. Wow👏👏👏 thank you so incredibly much, i am so happy you're doing this.What do you use to store your colourpop shadows (that’s behind you)?🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝Great progress. Thought it was funny when you dropped the lipstick. Did that yesterday with an eyeshadow palette but it was fine.I hope that the lipstick is still usable! You really made some great progress. I am so slow at using up foundation!Oh no your lipstick!! 😭 Two roll ins look at you!! 👏🏼👏🏼you are so close on that lipstick! well done!Yay!! Congrats on your progress!!✨🙌🏻We always have months that we don’t do as well and others that we smash ! Excited to see next months update xxParis!!! Nice!!!  That highlighter looks gorgeous!

Love the contrast between pink and blue!😍💕👌🏻 Hope to stay connected!💛Congrats on the empty, meeting goal on 2 products & getting to roll in 3! Great job, Gorgeous! TFS! ~ NonaOnce you get into the habit of using cream products it becomes so much easier to use them up. Great job on rolling out three.Congrats on great progress.  I rarely if ever use cream products for all the reasons you mentioned.. but it’s nice to hear you’re semi-converted.  Also!  Great eye look today and I like your hair styled that way!  Have a great week!Love ur videos short and fun to watch 😍I admire your consistency !Very impressive! I totally agree that cream products are easy to incorporate when you start reaching for them often! Also, major props for finishing that stila glitter!Yayyyy!!! 🎉🎉💝💝Omg Well done👏👏 what an incredible update. That mac liquid lip looks gorgeous. You have made such amazing progress. Your video is in the playlist. I am so so happy you're doing this ❤Oh wow 3 goals look at you!! Good job!! 👏🏼👏🏼Love your nail color! And your eye look is soo beautiful!  💕
Congrats on all the progress!Great progress xxSmashbox primer spray worked to rehydrate my glitters.I recently tried rehydrating a Stila glitter and it seemed like after rehydrating it the glitter fell out horribly...actually into my eyes 😡🤬🥺😆😆 
This huge panning collab has made me realize how slowly I pan. I just chose a number of times to use a product as a goal and I may end up extending that goal. 
Great progress! Yes I'm in this project.
New here 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔♥️♥️🔔I think you def will be able to hit 100 uses! That dip is so excitingYou’ve been doing well friend I love this background your makeup looks beautiful!I took a tip from Alex and used a cream highlighter today (a CP SS cheek). I have a BB cream on and it gives me a natural glow. I’m glad I can use it up that way instead of letting it go to waste.I like your hair do its so pretty and so elegant. Great job on trying to finish your cream products friend.Goalage is totally a word.....now.  lol Oh look at that bronzer dip!Really love your eyeshadow look!😍💕👌🏻 perfect for Valentine’s Day too! Hope to stay connected!💛You’re doing so well! I want to join in on this project next time around, I love it!You are gorgeous, Mariela! I love your eye look. You are doing so well with this project. That is a big dip in the Chanel bronzer. I have always wanted to try that, but I just haven't bought it bc it's pretty expensive, & I don't use cream products. TFS! ~ NonaI’m currently using a Stila glitter and glow and it’s almost to the point where I need to revive it. Rebecca Morgan says that she uses setting spray to revive hers when they dry out. I’m going to give that a try.I love the idea of usage as a benchmark! With blushes/highlighters/bronzers it can be really disheartening to feel like you work and work and work and nothing happens -- a 25/50/100 benchmark would help keep someone motivated.you're doing so well on all of your items! especially the bronzer those can be hard to stick to. can't wait to see more of your uodates!! i'm doing one as well :)you go girlOoo! Love seeing your progress! Thanks for sharing.Do you have a project pan video using up skin care productsGreat dent in that bronzer. You got the 100 uses. Go girl!Your video is so clear omggggg what camera do you use lolGood job with that bronzer! Nice dip!! 😁The one biggest piece of advice I can give with the stila’s is when you spray in product into it, put the stopper back in! 💝👍


Also, I use the ogx argan oil spray, it helps a lot! I also use to to bring my super shock shadows back to life!Such a cute project name! 🤩The Chan. Cream bronzer seems to be in a lot of projects this year. I really need to use my stila glitter and glows I bought them and hardly use them then I bought a mini set to I haven't even opened so I may give myself a goal for those.😘🎉🎉🎉Your background is gorgeous! 💝💝Damn girl good job on the primer! Way to go 🥰Lol maybe goalage should be a new word for panners 😉great progress! I used a facial oil to revive my stila glitter in the past and it did revive it but then there was major fall out! I want to try the contact solution now!Love your makeup! Is this project rolling? I did decide todo this project as well after seeing the playlist intros. I have finished 3/4 products so far. A cream lip liner, bbw lotion, and a la pro concealer. I still have an ulta beauty lipstick to work onLove that Chanel bronzer! I don’t know if anyone that has hit pan on it so if you do that would be awesome 👏🏼 great progress on everything. Keep it up 👍🏼What amazing progress Mariela. That chanel bronzer just looks so gorgeous. Thank you soOoooo much for doing this ❤EyedropsGoalage! I can be a word if you want it to! ;) I use eye drops with glycerin in it to revive my glitter and glows! I have that enchantress shade too! It's really pretty! That chanel bronzer is sooooo pretty! It's on my dream item wish list one day!  Great update!Wow great progress xxNice update!!Love these videos, beautiful nat!

Also, I am loving your nail colorLook @ you going through some cream products with a quickness! Lol! Keep up the good work, Nat! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaHey Nat! I agree - I'm not a fan of people who just dig straight down with project pan products. I like seeing even pans personally 👏👏👏That ColourPop, Part of Your World looks very good to me...It looks like the Chanel one I have my eye on...It's like....8 times cheaper....  : /  I need to get some nail polish. Great progress chickie...👍🏻Hey Nat. Wow you are making progress on that elf concealer. Good for you for using cream products 😍Great video!You have really good progress! I love seeing dips like that in those colourpop supershock formulas! Well done Nat!I look forward to seeing you progress on this! There are so many products that don’t deliver on claims!

You've gotten 10 Uses out of that tiny hair mask?! That's crazy. I love that you're really getting to test it out. Do you like it?

What type of brush do you use with cream shadows? I feel like no matter what I use it never works so I just use my fingers. I hate that it's drying out on you. 

I am discovering that shadow sticks last a lot longer than I thought they would. 

You have made quite the dent in the paint pot! 🙌Lovely update my friend.  I am panning a paint pot in another project and I have decided that I really don't like it which is unfortunate because I have so much left, lol.Great product choices and your dog!!! Omg!!!!adorable!!! My kids would love him!Your dog 😅 nice update!Loving this Project Pan series Kailee💛💛💛✨!I like everything you picked out for the project!

I’ve also had so much fun watching everyone’s updates today..thank you for sharing yours!!You're doing quite well with this project, Sweetie. I couldn't do it. Cream products don't work out very well on my oily skin. Love you, Beautiful! TFS! ~ NonaOmg your fur baby is adorable 😍❤️❤️❤️😍I love watching your updates 😊❤️The shadow you have is so pretty 😍Hello :)You've done so well Kailee 👏👏 you've had a lot of uses on your products. I LOVE your top.you are doing hreatLoved your update Kailee!I tried to pan a shadow stick last year and failed. They take forever! I tried to use mine as a base for shimmers as often as possible, and still...nah.Copper would look great with greens and yellow!:DHey girl!!!!!!Hey beautiful, I love that shirt and the color looks so good on you. 😘😘😘🤗🤗🤗Your lipstick looks beautiful on you! Now I’m intrigued about the Marc Jacobs liquid lip !Omg I look like death too 🤣🤣 omg twins?! How exciting!!I'm also confident that you will get where you want in this project, The main thing is that you're actually using those products and getting used to using creams, that's a big step on itself. Well done.
PS. Glad your son is back to himself. It's a big worry when you have kids, regardless of their age.
Thanks for sharing your progress Ashley. Looking forward to seeing your next ones! Love from the UK XAwwwwwww...I am sorry your Baby was sick. I hate it when Babies are sick bc they can't tell you what's wrong/how they feel/where it hurts...etc. I have been enjoying everybody's updates for this project today. Love you, Gorgeous! TFS! ~ NonaLook like death 😁😁😁 I'm hope to roll in my liquid Becca hughlight

New here 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔Wow girl! Awesome progress! Nice job finish two products up!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Please say one time hello everyone it's Alejandra 😊
I love how you say familia 😂Looks like you’re really enjoying this project. It’s so fun that we both have Dolce Vita in our projects. Game on!Ughh I hate when lipstick gets on your teeth 😤 I wear clear braces and it stains my trays so I stick to lip balms at work. Also, has “panning” made you notice anything that you didn’t before? I’m finding I like a dewy look and I have so many setting powders and sprays 😭You are making great progress!so glad i came across your channel - i've subbed!! i loveee these types of videos & i'm always looking for inspo for my project pan! can't believe you've used up a full highlight!My favorite thing about watching you is how you explain how a product works and who it works for. You just impart such important information that I just can't get from other channels. Woohooo look at that a big shiny highlighter pan!!Wow this is so cool! Hope to stay connected!💛Awesome progress!!!I’d toss that lipstick hahah..not worth the frustration to me but you should pat yourself on the back for powering through!! Great update!! ❤️Apply the lip product and pop your finger in your mouth and pull out. Should get the access on your inner rim off. Sounds stupid but worksAmazing Alex. 👏 that highlighter was so exciting haha. You are winning at this project. You are beating the creams to it❤Good idea about using the cream highlighter all over your face! I’m going to try that!I'll have to try that with my Physicians Formula highlighter. I've been working on it for a year now and it still has a way to go. It has gotten kind of crumbly on me, but I put a few drops of Inglot duraline in it and that revived it pretty well.I don’t know what you used on your eyes but it’s pretty!!!Great update and hooray for finishing the highlighter!  I am very focused on finishing a cream blush and cream highlighter, and I am swirling them together when I use them.  They make a very pretty, glowy blush!Great update. Nice to see two products gone. Such a win!!You are doing so well.  I’m in a little funk and haven’t been using anything.  Hopefully I’ll snap out of it soon.  I think this weather is getting to me.Wow you did so good!Nice update! I filmed an intro to this but still haven’t edited and uploaded it. I commend you for trying to use that product that gets on your teeth. I’d probably just throw it out out of anger!!Wow look at you!! Nice update 👏🏼👏🏼Wow!! I love following your project panning journey 🥰 you are such a panning inspiration for me and your content was definitely a reason for me to start my own journeys on Instagram 💕
xx from Germany😂😂 I'm always being told at work that I have lipstick on my teeth. I feel your pain. 
I still have to film and upload my intro. I'm so behind at the moment. 😩Do you remember where you got your earrings from? I love these project pan videos 💕You finished a highlighter!! Well done!I need to post my update 😭Wow Alex you killed it! Sooo impressive! Also, I love the shade diamond dust! The powder version is my favorite highlight ever!Oh my!!! You have been doing so so great!! 👍🔥Second! Is that a thing? 😁FIRST!!! 💝💝🎉🎉Wow great progress !!!Nice update! I’m happy I’m getting more use out of my cream products in this projectNice progress! You're the second person I've seen with NARS dulce Vida blush and my oh my y'all are brave and valiant in my eyes 👀😲😎💗
I am still tempted by that tastiest pro glow palette😊
Great progress. New here 
🔔🔔🔔♥️🔔
I also consider how long I've had an item when deciding what I put in my project pans.Well done!!😃I am working on this project as well. I think I am making study progress. But I  did not use one of my products at all so I have to focus on doing that.You did so well! A whole gram in 1 palette alone is fantastic! Good job!Your makeup looks so beautiful!❤You did so incredibly well Hélène. I loved seeing the measurements written on screen. Im excited for you with the cream product inside the powder palette 😂❤Yaaaayyyyy 🎂❤❤❤you make panning sss look so easy that I try doing it and fail miserably every time hahah loved yiur update as always xxOmg look at you working these products! Wow that soft pink blush😍😍😍😍
I have an elf blush stuck I thought about putting in this project but IT NEVER MOVES so I decided against lol 😊😊
New here 🔔🔔🔔💗🔔you have awesome progress omg!Hooray for an empty primer!!  Holy Smokes!!  Look at that cream blush!!! Totally wish I could rock a red lip like that!Wow a third of a red lipstick! And so much pans, you are doing so well!You did so incredible 👏👏i am keeping SS shadows in always too. I have 8 and i want pan on them all eventually. Your blush and highlighter progress was so amazing.You have done amazing with that blush and highlighter don’t think it will be long till both are out of your collection xxWow! Amazing progress! That blush and highlighter! So nice to see so much pan already :)That sleek cream highliter looks perfect in mix with cream blush.i finised them together a year ago.You can sheer out a SS shadow on top of a powder eyeshadow look.  That’s my favorite way to wear them, like a topper.  Just gently place your finger on top (don’t swipe) and pick up a very thin layer, and tap onto the center of the lid.  Makes them more wearable for every day.Great job. Look at you go! Love the red lip on you.I like the idea of having a lipstick and ss in a project I’m working on atleast panning my ss than them sitting drying up nice update!Wow! You have some awesome progress! That blush and highlight pan! I also love the idea of keeping a super shock shadow and a lipstick in this project! Very well done!🎉🎉🎉🎉Great update!I also had a fear of cream products ruining my makeup so I would buy them.. but not use them. But now im more excited to use cream products because of this project! you made some great progress!Great job so far!!  Thanks for the Update!Oh my goodness, look at all of that snow! LOL I love that you are filming in your pajamas!!Girl, for me, it's too much effort to put on an outfit most days.😂Great job!!! Thanks for sharing your progress! Always so inspiring :)I agree with you on the elf primer.  I am considering decluttering it.  I don’t think it does anything to smooth my pores.You are doing so well!!! 💝💝💝Well done Steph 👏👏 the cream bronzer is speaking to me. I am sl happy to see your progress. Your doing amazing❤I definitely think you are doing well! That liquid blush and the elf primer are very impressive! Great job Steph!Now, I love cream blushes! Look so natural and don't emphasize my pores! My favorites are 2 cool 4 school of colourpop and the bounce blush od bareminerals.You are doing so good. I wish my pjs looked that good on me 😂😂 maybe in the summer you can multitask the bronzer stick on your bodyGreat job so far 😁💕You are doing great!!! Also, love the snow outside your windows. So pretty.I’m with you on this project helping to use stuff more often my Chanel bronzer had slight usage but having it in this project I’ve already used 26 times!Love your project pan videosAmazing progress on the quad Paula !! Next update will be amazingWow you have such a great progress in some of these items and you're so close to being done!!!Great progress Paula! I started this project today 😊Next update is going to be super exciting 😁💕Yay!! Great progress!!
Wow!! Huge collab!! ItYay!! Great progress!!
Wow!! Huge collab!!I'm missing the 90s glamor shots hair today.  lol  Oh wow, look at that Elf corrector palette.  That will be so gone by next update. BAHAHAHAHA That extra day for Leap Year.  You crack me up.You are doing amazing! I'm sure you will have some empties by next month!Can’t wait to see you finish that Elf palette!!!Great update as always!!You are demolishing that elf color correcting palette! 🙌 You can really tell with that concealer stick too just how much you've used it. Oh, I wish the Supershock Shadows held up as well as the highlighters do! Lunch Money looks so gorgeous.ELF palettes are so you. I will mourn their passing and celebrate at the same time. 😏 It sounds like you really picked some great products.🤍🤍🤍Awww, thank you so much Paula ❤ that's so lovely of you. You've made such good progress. That concealer palette is on the way out👏🤗Ooooooh!!! I am going to bet that you will have 2 empties with this project next month!! 🎉💝👍🔥💝🎉🎉🎉I wonder if you can mix the first and last shade together of the darker elf concealer quad to get something similar to the third shade also in that pallet 🤔You've doing good Paula! I definitely think that elf concealer palette will be gone maybe even next update! Well done!OMG! You are almost done...finally! Lol! Great progress, Babe! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaAwesome job!  If you put shimmer in your inner corner of your eye you could put the shadow stick down first maybe?  You could also do that with the CP highlighter.

And my CP shades are all different, some have stood up well, some came dryer than usual, some I’ve had to fix, but my highlighters absolutely have done great!  I never thought of that 🤦‍♀️.  My SS blushes have actually been the worst, one even got discolored around the edges. 

💜 ~ Melissa (my son uses my account and got tired of having a girls name 😂)Whoa  great progress!🙌🏼Oh Paula you are soooo close on so.e of these.  Great job!!Just the ittiest bit left in that one quad!!  Whoo hoo!Wow Paula. Amazing progress!When the ELF creams go it will feel like the end of an era. I think they been in one project or another as long as I have been watching. You're making such good progress on everything.Love this project!!!That Concealer Quad will be gone before the end of February for sure! You so close on the Tarte Eyeshadow Stick and the Cream Bronzer as well!I feel like I should do this project because I have 85 CP SSS 🤦‍♀️I need to join this challenge.  Great progress. Keep it up.congrats on hitting pan on the sss!I absolutely love the products you have in here Tori. I wonder how many times this new super shock will take. The disney villains highlighter looks gorgeous.Love your sweatshirt! WOOHOOO Congrats on your pan in the SSS.I love your yellow eyeshadow look! So pretty and so glam!😍💕👌🏻 Hope to stay connected!💛Good job, Tori!!  Don’t be afraid to use the new SS shadow - it’s beautiful 😍Well done with the new pan! Good job!Yes! Pan in a Supershock Shadow! 🙌 Be Our Guest is such a pretty color. I love this yellow eye look. I'm curious which palette you used. You're doing so well!You got some really good progress !! Good job girl !Wow! An empty at the 1st update! Great job! I also have mad respect for anyone who pans liquid lipsticks!I love how realistic you are with your products and you don’t hold onto products that you know you don’t like or won’t get a ton of use xxI love how you've made this project kind of like a chopping blockYou are doing so well!👍I think the spin you put into this project allows you to really experiment with your products. I use more cream and liquids in the cooler months so this is a perfect project for this time of year :)Oh wow you hit pan on a SSS the hard way.  That is impressive. I really love those ColourPop eyeliners.  They last all day in my waterline and I also have watery eyes.Great job on your goals!! Thanks for sharing!!You've hit so many goals! I love that you are deciding to declutter in this project! Well done!I like the way you're doing this project. It gives you the ability to test out more items. Do you have a spot on, say, storenvy or something like it where you declutter items?  :)I love how you are doing this and making it for you 👏👏im loving the pixi liquid shadow on you. I'm so happy your doing this ❤Very unique way doing this project but if it’s working for you why not! I’m doing this also 😊Great update katariina xxYour sweater is beautiful. That is great that you can use that Elf in place of a concealer.  I like finding ways to multitask products like that.  Can't wait to see your next update!Hey new friend here! 
Hope we can support each other 🖤Yayyyy!!! 🎉🎉🎉Great progress!I am glad you found a way to use the more yellow shade. I think the contour shades are great for pale skin. TFS! ~ NonaLooking forward to your next update :]You can use the catrice spray like a lotion for monings ? :)Well done👏👏 so happy you are working away with that elf palette. It speaks to me😂❤Really great update! I am glad that you found a way to use that yellow shade!Great job Lori, you did really well!Sehr gut 👍👍👍👌👌Congrats on an empty! Primers take me forever! I do the same thing. I use only one for a month or two, then I am always so confused why my progress isn't bigger.You look really pretty in that color of green.Congrats on finishing the foundation, Babe & on getting to roll in a new product. That CP shadow is super pretty & so are you! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaYou’ve got such a good use on the blush ! Blushes are so hard for me so now I’m intrigued by liquid/cream onesI agree. If you hate a product, its not worth the hassle.Great progress!!You could either make your own lip scrub...🤷🏼‍♀️ sugar, colouring and some sorta oilI’ve resorted to using that Physicians Formula lip scrub as a leg exfoliator for after shaving them. That’s how I use up lip scrubs I don’t like and get my moneys worth out of them.If you can find Revlon Kiss Exfoliating Balm, that has been my go to scrub for a while.Use the scrub on your feet!I use that PF lip scrub in the shower, and follow up the scrub with washing my face. The suds work the oily residue away.I would have gotten rid of that lip scrub too if I hated to use it. You always make such good progress, Beautiful! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaI had the elf lip exfoliater in coconut that I added to my cart on their site forever ago to get free shipping & it took me forever to finish but once I did, I missed having a lip scrub in my collection. I just got the wet n Wild watermelon lip scrub yesterday but I’m not too crazy for the consistency. It’s really just grit & nothing else, so maybe that would be something you might like. It smells amazing too. Like watermelon jolly ranchers!!Awesome progress! I always love watching your videos. I'm totally with ya on decluttering that lip scrub - no point in using something you don't like! (As some other people suggested, if you really wanted to use it up, you could probably use it as a body scrub in the shower and run through it in one use.) <3 Can't wait to see your updates!❤️No worries about being late. I was too! LolYes, girl, just toss that lip scrub! Others are suggesting that you use it on your feet, and I was going to say the same, but not if it leaves a gross, waxy residue. 😝You could use the scrub for your feet:)Oh no with that lip scrub! I completely understand wanting to declutter it! I love that you are going to roll liquid lips in and out, That is such a good idea! Great update!I hate that waxy residue some lip scrubs have😖 I agree, just toss it!Yes! Don't force yourself to use something that's terrible. I feel like that kills the point of project panning. You've made such great progress on everything!Hey there name twin! ♥️♥️ you have some good progress! If I just simply dont like or enjoy an item I allow myself to take it out of my project pan bc I have soooo much makeup anyways 🤷‍♀️💕💕The same thing happened to me with the butter highlighters. Towards the end it got crumbly. Glad you are feeling better. It's that time of year.In my year long project I took out a foundation I didn’t enjoy using with one I liked so I say take out that pf scrub! Great update!🎉🎉🎉🎉

Ewww rotten playdo is never goodI know this is going to sound weird but I’m always surprised when I see that using a product really leads to it being used up. I had never focused on one product so never really saw progress. Since I started project panning I’ve focused on products and actually used them up! Still seems weird to me 😅I'm the same way - if I really dislike a product, I don't want want to force myself to pan it!I thought you said ‘rotten Plato’ instead of ‘rotten playdoh’ 😝Use the lip scrub as a foot scrub!If you have duraline, you can add a couple of drops to that highlighter and revive it. I think that would make it a lot easier to use ☺  You've made good progress so far!Great progress! I think tossing the lip scrub is a good call! You don’t want tot torture yourself lol..thanks for sharing!!You may want to use that lip scrub in your elbows, knees and feet...a couple of eyedrop drops on the top of that highlighter and it should be like new. btw I've been feeling very bad emotionally because of depression and had lost interest in makeup but your videos have been helping me get backGreat job!!I am so happy you are doing this. Thank you so much. I am glad you are feeling better. I agree about throwing away the scrub. It was a success because now you know for sure how you feel. That highlighter looks amaaaazing wow. Id also love to try those flower beauty blushes❤Yaaayyyyyy ❤Yay better late than never 👏🏼welcome to the panning groupI am so happy you're doing this Linda 🤗🤗 i need to try some lipsticks as blush.I started this project today 😊Yay! Welcome to the project!I love using lipstick as blush! Great choices!I am so glad that you are joining!!! Yay!!!!So glad you are joining.  Good luck!!Is that nyx lipstick the last of the round lipstick? Nice that it's moving fast!!Hahahha I feel the same about the sss! I feel like people hit pan so easily and I’m like ??Again more reasons we should be friends lol. I never realized until now how similarly we speak. 

Anyways main comment here: I have never seen this Harry Potter Project Pan and omg I’m so excited to see where this goes! I am totally going to join in for that one. I’ve been on a Low Buy year so far (it’s going well for two months in) but I haven’t actually been using much lately. I just had my second baby this month so it’s been rough getting time to myself dealing with a newborn who’s constantly hungry, a toddler who’s super energetic, and a husband who needs attention as well lol. But maybe this will be a good way for me to get to use up some makeup again. I can’t wait to see how the Harry Potter Project Pan works. Also when will that be coming out? I need something to look forward to! ❤️❤️❤️Everyone else: panning a super shock shadow. Me: thinking of purchasing my first super shock shadow 🤔😍I love the overall amount of super shocks in this project! I have a Disney one in mine too and I been hearing lots of ppl using them under foundation 😎😎 (may need to try this 🤔)
I have a nail polish the color your nails in my Partners in cream project  💅🏽🙌🏽
New here 🔔🔔🔔💗🔔🔔i still feel like you made amazing progress! can't wait to see more from you - i love project pans !That highlighter looks so pretty and the lipstick. Im so happy you're doing this ❤Your skin is glowing!!! Got a video on how you achieve that?:)You have great progress!

I love itSo I’ve been low key binging on your entire project pan playlist and will be eagerly watching all your other stuff soon. Love your content and excited for this update!!! ❤️I’ve always loved how you do your makeup but I really have been loving how your makeup looks in the past few videos!Oh my!! Harry is coming back!? Yesssssss!!!My rosacea= never having to use blush. 😳☺️😳🎉🎉🎉🎉I went and swatched the Colourpop highlighter you use under your foundation and saw it has glitter. Does this look glittery under foundation? Thanks 🙂Yay! I can’t wait for the Harry Potter project pan again this year! It was one of my faves. I’m gonna join in and follow along at home 😁 well done - you’ve made some great progress on your products - I know what you mean about DGAF, it is a really interesting colour to work with. I love pairing it with a cool tone shimmer like a champagne gold coz I almost see some gold reflecting in DGAF and I think it plays off that really nicely ☺️Love your makeup look! 😍 Could you please post a tutorial on your makeup look?Good job overall! I don't think I'll hit my goal this month... Maybe. I've lost a week of wearing makeup due to being sick. Well see. 😂#NotificationSquad :) I have been waiting all day for this!!!The green gold sss is beautiful! Great progress xx"They're very soft" LOL! I love it! You have really good progress on those shadows! You will probably have pan by next update! Well done!Hope you feel better xxJust subbed because I just found you! I love project pans and was thinking of doing this partners and cream project pan haha 

But I didn’t realize you were sick. I’m sorry but  you don’t have to worry about the way you look! You look great but I’m sorry you have to deal with a chronic illness. I can’t wait for your regularly upload schedule!I have that same inner voice that says not to use my favorite items up all the way. I'm trying to silence her some. lol.  Alex is a panning beast! :) But I hope you don't judge yourself too harshly. You decluttered an item, and that is already a success in my book.I hope you feel better soon! Any progress is good progress, Sweetie! TFS! ~ NonaWow hitting pan in a highlighter in a month even if it’s shallow is quite a feast!You made such good progress. I cannot get ovet the shaanxo palette. I wish i was this good at panning creams😂❤👏That deep shade is challenging, but your progress is soooo good! Great job!Great progress! I'm sure the nude lipstick will be gone in couple of months :)You are doing amazing with this one, Gorgeous! Pan in every lipstick! TFS! ~ NonaTry the deep lipstick mixed with the orange/coral shades, or even try it sheered as a stain.Amazing job on those lip products. I think that darker shade would be beautiful in the fall as both a lip & cheek color. I'm definitely a product multi- tasker. LolGreat progress!  Maybe you could combine that super dark lipstick with another color in the palette to help tone it down. It is a very pretty shade!You are doing amazing!Great job Miss Elisabeth!! Can you use the lip products as cream blush maybe?FIRST 🎉🎉🎉🎉You made some really good progress good job xxYour lipstick is beautiful! Great update! That blush looks beautiful too!You are doing great! That Stila glitter is on its last leg. TFS! ~ NonaI’ve been enjoying cream blush lately too nice update friendGreat update, Rania!!  I can’t believe how close you are to finishing the Stila !If like it have fun with itI love your hair and the products you chose. The contour and the kaja blush is speaking to me through the screen. Im doing a stila glitter too and i wish could make the progress your making 😂🤗❤Good job Clara xxYaaay i am so happy Clara. You're video is in the playlist. Well done on progress already. It was a great idea to have a foundation in❤Welcome to the project Bettina better late than never ! great product choicesI am planning flexitarian. Since it is so intense and blinding, I apply it to my face before I put on foundation and it gives my skin a nice glow. Just a tip!Hello! I am new to your channel! I am trying to sub to everyone doing this project bc I love to watch panning videos. I am terrified of cream products so I am quite intrigued to follow your progress. I do beauty content as well if you would be interested. TFS! ~ NonaFlexitarian is definitely harder to use than other super shock cheeks because of how intense it is! But you will do great! I really enjoyed your picks and I'm excited to follow along! Thanks so much for joining!Great way to get more use of your ss I’m bad on hitting pan on mine before they dry up 😬The super shock colours are so nice! All the best for the panning 👍Yay so glad you joined. Those super shock shadows are so pretty.I like the Colourpop Supershocks, I 've managed to go thru a highlighter.  Because they are soft I found it easy to hit pan on.  The blushes & eye shadows takes a lot longer but I don't think the eye shadows are particularly deep.I was surprised how shallow the pans are in the Colourpop SS shadows. I hit pan on one and didn’t use it even close to 30 times. 🙂I had to throw away my color tattoos in my last declutter because they were rock hard. 😩The color tattoo has such a good dip going !! Great introVery useful video dearExcellent choices! Thank you so much for joining us! I am excited to see how you will do!Hey new friend here!

At least you are getting some use with all you have going on! No apologies neededDon’t beat yourself up you still did really well xx and good luck with nursing schoolI hope you get some time for yourself. I completely understand being busy and missing makeup playtime! Great update! Also, I loved that you matched the emoji so well with your purple sweater! :)you did goodYou will find your groove. I do miss seeing your GRWM etc. Don’t study too hard 🤪You did SO good !!! Can’t wait for the next update xxI have been watching all of your videos today haha I needed to catch upYou made such amazing progress. Im so thankful you're doing this.

Congrats on your progress!what lipstick are you wearing? it’s stunning + i love your eye look xxYou're sooo good with using up stuff T_T Nice that you could roll in a new item!
I'm a person who uses no foundation (only CC creames) and no bronzer at all. I'm kind of happy that I have fewer 'temptations' when it comes to buying new make-up tho. :DYou always have great progress! Also that mustard coloured top makes your skin look amazing 😍Yay one product done!!You're doing so good!I like your eye look 🙂Lexi was cracking me up 😂 I get like that sometimes where I barely use any makeup. We have those days. Great job. One down woohooI'm loving your eyelook😍My goal for 2020 is to finish up all my primers and just use my moisturizer and probably have a pore filler one and a matte one. I want to start having a minimal collection and 2020 is the year to do soGreat progress 🙂You are doing so well with all of your projects! Congrats,very inspiring!🥇🥳
Tip:Maybe You could try mixing your dark foundation with a sunscreen? This is what I did, when once I bought a hideously white-and very expensive- sunscreen. So I mixed it with my summer foundation and it was great! Like a tinted moisturizer, maybe could do the trick for You also!I've also been a little lazy with my makeup lately 😅! I think you have great progress though! Impressive as always!Look at you! Yay for rolling in a new product!your dog <3awesome contentWoohoo good job xxI would love to be able to use my foundation as quick as you 👏👏 i love your eye look. Turns out we both have the same eye look for this update😂😂 great minds think alike❤ well done on making so much progress.Hi new here 🔔🔔🔔💗🔔
Nice progress but don't stress yourself out 😄😄😄
I love project pans but when I join big collabs like this I realize how slowly I pan 
👀😲😬😩😌☺️☺️☺️☺️Yay for some empties!You look great in those eye colors Amanda!! KarolCome on, bust that bottle!!  lol We are hanging....Totally agree about the urban decay color corrector.  It keeps  going and going.Yay for the two empties!  I’m hoping the next cream product that leaves my collection is an IT Cosmetics blush.  It has major pan and I use it at least five times a week... It’s nice and it looks even prettier when I mix it with a cream highlighter for a glowy blush but sometimes I just want to say get out already, and stay out!  Haha!You look gorgeous Amanda! I love the eyelook and your skin is 😍
This is really a great project and I'm tempted to do it! 🤔Dang! 2 empties! Well done! I am so jealous of hoow quickly you went through that foundation! Lol :)yay 4 empty btw are you using eyeliners in your brows..Congrats on finishing the foundation, Beautiful! Love you! TFS! ~ NonaHave you ever panned something you struggle with?Love this eye look!!The stila glitter actually looks really nice with the blue. Wouldn’t have thought of that combination. You’re so great for still managing to use all the products in your projects at least once! That’s definitely not easy.You look great! Shirt, makeup, everything is so beautiful! The Huda cream highlighter looks huge, but I bet you'll be able to have a lot of progress in the warmer months!Your top is beautiful ! Yas girl with the closeups 👏🏼👏🏼 and yes to the pan👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼great update as always Steph ! And good luck on your exams 💕I should be studying right now 🤣🤣Yayyyyy!!!! 💝💝💝💝Love your look today.

I've been curious about this project! And was actually thinking of a very similar project last year using all liquids n creams, but I never jumped on it. So its neat to see your guys! I'd love to possibly join, but maybe when some of my other projects end! I'm doing a freaking ton! Lol.Ohh I'm excited to see if the super shocks are consistently 30 usesGood luck with your exams!

Also I’m loving your eye makeupI hope your exam goes well. You’ve got this!Yes!!! I’m so excited for this update! I really want to join it but don’t have enough cream items! HahaI am OBSESSED with this eye look!

You're making tons of progress! Cant wait to see you hit pans/goal!!Good luck with your exams! <3Stay strong and focused! 💪🏽🍀✨Good luck with your exams! 
I am still in love with that red colour pop shadow 😍 Maybe you can try adding it on top of a red lipstick for some more glitz? Although I am not sure how appropriate red lips are at your work 🙂I hope your exams are going well! I don't know how you manage all that you do! Much love Steph!Love the editing!Prayers for your exams, Gorgeous! You will do great! Keep up the good work, Sweetie! TFS! ~ NonaExams are hard.

I love cream blush and contour and this is very inspiring! 
Ewww...potted items😂😂😂 I hate having to stick my fingers in! I'm excited about spring and need it hear asap!! (Even tho I dont have any spring makeup in my project pans 🤨)I have that Laura gellar stick and it works nicely. I need to remember to use it more!You’re eyeshadow is gorgeous today! But the liquid blush is so pretty but you’re doing really well!The blush progress is very impressive! This lip combo is beautiful too! Kicking butt as always! Great job!What brush do you use for the potted lipstick?You're doing well with your products especially that blush.I love this project! I almost wanted to join it but when i found out of it i already had a lot of cream products in other projects, maybe another time. And I am 100% with you about lips products in a jar.i always look forward to your updates! i agree i will never hate pan anythingYou are doing great! 40 times for that blush is a lot!👍Great job.  I finally cleaned and organized my skin care and makeup so that I use stuff up before it expires.  Thanks for keeping me motivated.❤️I miss your GRWM chit chats or revisiting older palettes grwm 😫You’ve made such great progress on the Nars cream blush! 
I’m so ready for Spring!
I don’t like lip products in pot form either 
You’re doing so well!This is what I’m wearing on my teeth... lol I’ve been enjoying cream blush will be exciting once you roll in a new one ☺️Lool youre hilarious when you dont even try to be. So refreshing!The Nars liquid blush is hard to use up because you need so little, you're doing amazing on that one!I’m trying to use up some of makeup and was wondering how you pan your things... do you wear makeup everyday? Even when you’re just hanging at home? Or do you have any tips on finishing up products? ... do you use 1 product until you finish it or do you use different products? I’d be grateful for any help or tips!Yay! You’re doing amazing..I love your thoughts on “hate pan”..thanks so much for sharing your progress!!I really enjoy following your panning journey. Can I suggest that you melt the ears lip product in an empty tube? I use this uric with my pot lip products that I wanna finish and it helps me do that easier and quicker. xx🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉I love your hair today!  Congrats on your empty! I am still waiting for my first makeup empty for 2020.Im lying in bed about to put phone away and i see this pop up haha. You've made such good progress. I must try cream blush again. I have never tried tatcha but i really have to look into it. So happy to see your progress❤Hi DaLin! I love the products you rolled in.  You have the prettiest Stila glitter shadows.  I am enjoying everyone’s updates 💕You’re really making very nice progress on your products! Love the colors of the new products you rolled in ;)Awesome update Dalin!!! I also LOVE your eyeshadow! So pretty!!Wow that pur contour stick feels like a ripoff!! The still highlighter dip is just wow so good ! You’re so close ! And Your eyeshadow is absolutely stunning !Excited to see ur progress 
I enjoyed so much the video keep doing this amazing job. I know you will completely blow up a day .I would appreciate if you check my last video it will help me a lot.I love that you're using usage goals to make panning work for you! Yay for all your progress!Nice work. I don’t think you’ll regret the shadow variety. Happy to hear you’re also feeling better!Hi frnd!! This lipstick is gorgeous on you! Jll be grabbing this playlist and add it to my own video.
Excellent progress!! 🌻🌻🌻🌻
The new rolled in stilas are gorgeous! Icy white blue is so hard to use on a daily basis.
I'm excited for tour new projects and goals!! Good luck 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀3 roll outs look at you!! Woohoo!! You are doing great.What brand is that contour stick? Good thing you got it on sale! :)Hello 🌞!! Great progress on your products 👍👏👏👏!! I've got some cream products in my subscription boxes over the last year, maybe I should try some of them soon. I get a bit terrified of cream products, I just don't know how to use them 🙈🙈🙈. Wish you a good and healthy week ahead 😘!!Almost done with the cream bronzer! Wow, they really didn’t put a lot of product in that tube 
I have put Stila glitters in my project pan and I struggle with it so much 
You’ve made such great progress! I need to join in on this project next time because I neglect my cream productsLook at you go! I would almost smash that duo stick product into something else to be able to use it all 🤣Yayyyy!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉Yay just subbed! I’m loving these project. I was watching stephs video and came to sub to you! I was thinking of joining you guys! But need to make sure I have enough cream products hahahaOhh great progress I’m doing usage goals on my Stila glitters too just easier to see progress plus I think you’d probably be drying up the glitter opening the lid up each time.. anywho great progress! 😊I love these eyeshadows on you! What palette/colours dis you use? Very happy that your project is such a succes! 💜🍀✨Glad you’re feeling better!! Great job on your progress 😊 I have been enjoying the contour stick I’m using in this project too. Seems we’re all working on some stila glitter and glows lolGreat idea to have a usage goal vs struggling to mark visible progress..you did SO well this month!! The lip product looks amazing as a blush!! Thanks for sharing! ❤️Great progress and such an ambitious goal with the Stila Glitters! Excited to see your progress next month 🤗Great video! Your eyeshadow look is gorgeous!Omg DaLin i Love the products you rolled in. You did so so well. I think i own that supershock so i hope i hit my goal soon😂 well done ❤Love this project! My update will be up tomorrow but awesome progress!That is crazy that the contour stick only had that lil of product. You are doing great, Beautiful! I think usage goals are more realistic for those Stila shadows. Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaGood for you for switching out a product and rolling in another item!! I would do the same !I would have rolled it out as well. Maybe you can add it to your polish before it dries if you don’t want to use it on your faceI completely think rolling something out for another project that works better for you! 😂😂yes! We got to to get to getting!!😀😀
I tend to put new products in my project pans 😂😂😂
Great progress! Keep up the good work 💟💟💟💟💟I am curious to hear how that elf lip lock works out for you! It's smart of you to roll in something new that is more realistic! Well done all around!I’m almost done with a lip liner and I am super excited to use it up! And start working on an other one. 🙂Sorry you had to ditch an item from your project, but hopefully you can still get some use out of it and show us the progress you were able to make by the end of this project?💕👍🎬Hey beauty 😍👋🏼🌹
Back here catching up.... seeing your last part1 ..... Iam definitely will be look into that!! 😯💕   I appreciate ur honesty with each of the products u used and experience 💄💋!! Blessing beautiful 🦋🤍Oh, I would totally roll out that topper as well. If it's not something that you can use with consistency, then you won't make the progress you want. Just use it on your terms now and enjoy it. 😘I went to Ulta the other day to buy a birthday gift and stopped by the Colourpop display to take a look at their eyeliners.  And, they didn’t carry the gel eyeliner, just the liquid. That purple eyeliner is so pretty for spring!  Don’t stress about switching products, use one that works for you and you will get finished!I think you did absolutely fantastic. Progress is progress. I think you can reach the 2 goals ❤I think it is totally OK to roll that one out & put in something that will work out better for you, Sweetie. Love you! TFS! ~ NonaI have one of those ud lip toppers in an irredescent gold green flip color and also use on my eyes too it’s pretty! I’m so close to finishing one product! My update will be up in the morning! 😌Got a notification of an upload and was like who is uploading this late? Then like a lightbulb went off and I shouted JESSICA!!! And clicked so fast to watch 😆 😆Great update as always!!The lilac lipstick is so pretty, but on my light skin I usually have to use shades like that as an accent on top of another color, or I look like a clown.Your top is so pretty specially with you hair color ! Good for you for removing the cp highlighter , you still got amazing progress on it. That tf spf is. So. Close.!! Great update as always xDefintely move out items if they dont work!!!Yes maam!! Good progress and makeup should be fun Not torturous. Love the spf product, so important! I'll need a new spf soon as well 
Grwt work name twin! 💮💮💮💟💟💟💟💟💟💟You have such a soothing relaxing voice. I hope that isn’t a weird compliment but I thought you should know how nice it is to just listen to your videos sometimes.Hi! I was wondering if the colourpop packaging is magnetic if you remove the pan? If it is you could use that packaging for the Anastasia highlighter you were talking about in your last shop my stash! :)I don’t hate pan either. Not worth it when we all have amazing makeup waiting to be used. Great job.I think it’s good to declutter items you don’t enjoy. It’s makeup, it’s supposed to be fun!You hit pan! That's enough effort for something that you aren't a fan ofYayyyyy!!! 🎉🎉🎊🎊You did so great! I love the maleficent hilight in my inner corner since it is so sparkly but I can see how it can be too much for some people!I’ve learned to roll out stuff I don’t like cuz then I won’t use them great work!! You’re doing great!❤️Glad you took out the colorpop highlighter that you weren’t enjoying..I’m excited to see what you’re able to do with lunch money..you’re making such great progress on all of the other products!! Great job!!I kind of want to start this project! HahahYour progress is amazing. I am so happy that you are having fun ❤Lunch money is my favorite super shock highlight that I have tried (out of 5 shades). You are doing great as always!I totally agree with you abt forcing yourself to use products you don't enjoy. Make-up is supposed to be fun! You are doing great, Beautiful!

You did SO well on that blush and everything else !I’ve seen a lot of people panning the Flower Beauty blush and that makes me want to pick one up!  Mixing foundations is one of my favorite things to do.  Just subbed and glad I found you. ~Patricia ❤️I am working on the revlon candid foundation I agree with you on this product I love th finish but it does not last on me and I have dry skin so you would think it would last longer.I find project pan is kind of like moving with someone.

I’m loving your eye makeup todayGirl I get hyped about lip balms and treatments too 🙌🙌Oh my gosh I am so proud of your progress!  You really are so close on that contour stick especially.  You are going to run out of so many things all at once!I was wondering what was behind you. I thought it was another home. And then I see a man walk across behind you and couldn’t help but laugh 😂😂😂 
I bet you will roll out all 5 at once. Don’t stress yourself out. You have great progressI’m trying to get through all my mini primers. And then start on my full size ones. It’s nice to finish up makeup 💖You got this!! 💪💪🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Great progress!!😃Yay Steph 🎉Wow, you're doing really well. I added a product, but my original 3 are going to be in my project for awhile. 😂 But it's best not to compare! You look lovely too btw. 💖I was just thinking we’re gonna need a room tour of your new filming space! Would love to see it once you’re settled in! Nice update missyYou’ve made insane progress on that blush!! Great job!!I always mix my foundations too!Holy cow! You have such great progress! Well done! That blush! Wow!Good job with that blushSame with the green corrector. I really love it, aswell for my nose hahaYAY! your cream quad is done!! :D 2 empties! You've done well! ^_^ Great progress!Your doing so well on so many of your projects this year! So exciting to see :) I had been using foundation for a long while and then decided to stop buying it and only use concealer on some blemishes etc. I got used to it, so I have a feeling you will be able to get used to not having a green concealer. Once this is done of course ;p good luck on your other and new products!What a exciting update. Omg Paula go you👏👏 im happy about the bare minerals lipstick.Yes to 2 empties ! Seeing that empty quad is so satisfying👏🏼👏🏼 great update as Always  Paula !!Yay!  On the ELF concealer quad!   Awesome progressYou are doing great in this project!  2 empties!Well done, Paula ❤ happy to see you dancing gleefully.I'm totally jealous of your empties!!!  WOOHOO!! You finished an eyeshadow stick!!!  It will be nice to see you with 2 empty ELF quads at the end of the year.Oh my goodness!  That Elf palette is all gone!!Great job! Two empties?! I’m so jealous.  I am trying to use up the super Shock Shadow Wattles, the SS blush in Prenup, and the SS highlighter in On The Cusp, and no pan on any yet.  Also just trying to get ten uses out of two Mary Kay cream shadows.  Only two uses so far, but am working on a bunch of stuff right now.  You always provide me with inspiration to keep working on them!Love watching your videos. Nice empties!Hooray for empties!!You are making such great progress in all of your projects!! Keep up the good work :)It looks like 2020 is treating you better than 2019 did 😊 I hope that's the case! Both makeup wise and health wise!You are killing this project, Paula! Goodbye Elf concealer quad! Lol! So happy for you! Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaNice progress!Hi Paula...You do a great job panning...Thanks for the update..youre on a roll, paula! love the hair and the nail polish.Whoa look at those empties! Next update I’ll be able to roll another out! Great job Paula! 💖You did so well this month! It will be interesting to see how long that lipstick is going to take, it could be done in a month or take a while. That green corrector will definitely take a while lol, once you are done you can try shape tape to see if that covers the redness without a corrector.Nice progress on your chosen items. A green color corrector would take forever to finish. Bare Minerals formula 4 liquid lipsticks is one of my favorite. Good luck on your project pans!I loved the little victory dance for your empties!  That liquid lipstick will probably be gone in 10 uses. You’re doing so well on this project.Hey, a different camera angle. 😀Paula! That elf palette is such a big accomplishment! Well done all around!Woohoo for 2 empties. This is your year Paula and of course I finally get to do a project with you too...in a way 🤪I’m so happy for you...empties!  Yeah!!!  I really like your blue nail polish you’re wearing...glad you added it to your Project 10 uses 😊Great progress! It would be great to do this project again next year, I may join 😊You got this!!! 💪💪🎉🎉Woohoo empties!!!! 💃 💃🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝I really like the background. Plants always make me happy and it seems to have a bit of personality, which is always nice. Great progress! One rolling out already and the sleek highlighter. Wow!Congratulations on your move and its a lovely background. How are you finding filming with your bf home the same time or have you had to do it yet?? You've done so so well. Omg what impressive progress 👏Girl!!!!’ That pan in that highlighter from sleek. I was not sure how to use that product but now I do because you gave great advice! Putting it in my project immediately! Thanks girl!I think you will def hit goal in the sleek oh my gosh!Just found your channel and I absolutely love it !Congrats on the move ! I love the background with the guitar and the plants gives so much life to your videos ! Great update as always specially on the sleek cream highlighter  and blush xx you are so close to finishing so many products !It's always amazing how you regulary pan red shades!Your cheek area is so beautiful , i think cream products looks so good on youLove to see your Update! And your makeup looks sooooo pretty! 🥰✨I like the new area. But I don’t mind where you film. Great job on meeting goal on one. Your makeup looks so prettyLove the background the chair is off but saw you commented you’d be removing it other than that looks great! You’ll be done with that blush so soon!! Nice progress 😊So much pan you are doing great! And hopefully you can get comfortable and figure out your ideal set up!You have some really good progress! Well done! I'm excited to see how that liquid lip goes!I hope your move went well!I really like this background (except maybe the chair, that doesn't really fit). In my opinion the colour balance is better with a background that is not stark white.You’re doing amazing! You’re so consistent with your products and there’s so much progress already. Very motivating to see ;)You're doing so so well. The new stila looks stunning. Id probably call the 1st stila an empty cos you used it. Thank you so much ❤Congrats on the 50 uses! I also just called one of my stila"s done that I was panning because it dried outYou are doing so great!!! 🔥🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊 your shirt is so stinking cute!! I have a crescent moon and sun tattoo!!💗You have such a good dip on the bronzer ! It’s such a huge tub! Great update as always xxYour eyeshadow is so pretty :DYour shirt is so cute!! 😍I really like your top. Dang that TF primer had quiet the product still like when you put it next to the light I was like wow. Good job on the Stila I feel like those are never ending and they dry out super fast.I've always wondered if that chanel bronzer pulled warm. I want one to try but not at that price.You are doing so good, Gorgeous! Congrats on 50 uses on the Chanel bronzer! TFS! ~ NonaI love this project pan and watching everyone's update is so cool  :D 
Also i love your shirt  !  Where did you buy it  ?Well done! 💜💜💜50 uses already is awesome!!! 😁👍👍😁👏You got it right! 😁You're doing really well!You look so so pretty ! Suscribed 💗✨Love the flowers in the background!! I like the idea of usage goals..something I never thought about until kind of recently. You’re doing a great job!!!I watched on the makeup breakup that it took I think 100 uses to use up a 4.5 ml glitter n glow. I’m not sure the size of that one. The 100 uses were with the stopper taken out as well.I have totally been wanting to try the channel cream bronzer. Congrats on the stilaWhere is your shirt from?? 😍
I hate how fast the Stila glitters dry out 
You’re making great progress!I’ve been so behind on watching videos but I’m here 🤪 I still love your nails! Great job on hitting some goals. Woohoo! That bronzer would be gorgeous in the summer.You are doing a great job!I haven’t heard of this project pan before! I really like the idea though! Also, your makeup in this video is stunning!Good job!!! I’m posting mine later tonight and definitely made some progress!Your skin looks amazing in this video!I always forget to tally! But I love that yours is on a sticky note! I feel like that would make it easierAlso I love your background! Its so prettyYES!!!! I am loving the partners in cream updates today!❤️Oooo i would love to see telepathy on you. You were so successful already👏👏great update as always!Great job on the stila glitter!! The milk blush is beautiful ! xxCongrats on getting to roll in 2 new items! TFS! ~ Nona2 roll ins! Great job! That telepathy shade! 😍Telepathy would be so pretty in the inner corner, or all over the lid, with a bold black liquid liner!You’re doing great!! Thanks for sharing your progress!Maybe you can use the Gold supershock and then use another shadow or shadows over it or around it to tone it down a bit? I find I use a supershock a few times and then forget I have them. lol I added a Stila glitter to my project. The other 3 items will probably take awhile to use up half way (my goal). lol You're doing pretty good! I love your shirt btw!I am loving your shirt! So pretty. Great job. I used to own telepathy as well. I don’t own any super shocks anymore. That one is tempting me.Telepathy is such a beautiful shade I need to use mine cuz it may be drying up too 😬 I’m horrible using my ss shadows nice update! 😊Omg you got your hair done and its stunning. I love it. Your makeup is absolutely gorgeous. I love the colourpop shades you have omg. You're doing so well. Mine so far have taken 30 uses i wish mine would be quicker 😂Great job rolling in 2 new products !! For flexetarian you can apply it before blush and bronzer and it kind of tones it down (that’s how I use my super intense cp highlighters when I want a more natural glow )I love your hair!! So cute! And your makeup is stunning!!!Your eyeshadow is beautiful! New roll ins!!!! Great job!I love your eye look & your hair! Really gorgeous! Maybe you could layer a powder blush on top of the cream one? TFS! ~ NonaLove your eye look and hair! Great panning too 👍Your eye shadow is popping here Bettina.   Good work with your products   xxWow! Your colourpop birthday cake looks nothing like mine!  You've inspired me to get mine out and start using it.  It's a lovely color so I want to enjoy it before it's too late.
It goes grrat with a matte brownLove your hair!! Looks so cute!Love your makeup!Go ahead and wear that colorpop highlight to work!! I bet no one would think anything of it. Great progress!!

Random thought your floors look really pretty and clean! 😅 I’m doing this project too 😊Wow you look absolutely gorgeous😍I love your glasses. I haven’t tried any of these products, I would love to🥰I enjoyed watching you I subscribed🤩I have a beauty channel I hope we stay connected👑✨You are so cute dear .. loved your video . Hey new friend added in your YouTube FAMILY and i would love if u could also be a part of my youtube FAMILY dear and let's just STAY connectedI’m currently on the fence about if I like cream foundations at all. I had a stick on which I loved and I’m also thinking I prefer light coverage like a BB Cream. The woes of actually figuring out what you prefer. I have 2 foundations that aren’t my shade too and I’ve been mixing them each time I use them but I’m thinking about mixing them completely in a bottle.  It sure yet.💕👍🎬
Hey beauty!! 👋🏼🌹😍
Grate review beauty on each of the products!! 💄💋💕😍Oh no about the becca foundation! I am not someone who really has a go to ride or die foundation. I love complexion products, but I don't think I have found "the one" just yet. Great update!I love the UD color corrector.  My lasts forever toohellooooo glasses!The perils of finding a good foundation. Lol! Love you!

Well done! That highlight stick! Great job! Those cream eyeliners are so hard for me to use, but yours is going really well!You are doing great, Beautiful! TFS! ~ NonaThere’s always next month xxI am glad to hear how the jcat compares to colourpop. I have always been curious.❤️I love your eye makeup!Still can’t believe how easily you use that highlighter even tho you say the pan is shallow 😄very visually satisfyingi def. think you can finish that highlight by the end of the year! Well done!Great job on that highlighter. It looks so pretty tooI love this look, Beautiful! Green & orange are so perfect together. All progress is good progress! TFS! ~ NonaI love the green eyeshadow!!Great progress! Also I’m loving the green eye look! 💚Progress is progress, even if it’s just one or two uses. Great job!🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊I’m glad you’re feeling better girl!! Great update as always xxOmg Hélène you poor thing you must of felt awful and scared. I am so glad that you are feeling better. I love that you include the total gram reduced. The blush looks beautiful on you and i love the bronzer❤1.41g in spite of being sick! That's really good! I am glad you are feeling better!You’re doing very well good job!!So glad you’re recovered!You're doing really well 👏👏👏Awesome update girl! I love that lipstick!Great update girl xxYay for finding  way that you like using that blush! That's another big reason why I love panning. It makes me figure out products that I might have given up on otherwise. And that contour pencil is going great! Well done!Well done you are doing so so well. Paint pots are so hard. I feel your pain. I can definitely see dip. Poor lil onesie. Im happy you got to roll in something.Nooo not the onesie xD ! Great update as always xxI have 2 paint pots in projects as well and I am feeling the regret 😝I have no knowledge about cruelty free perfume, but bronzer, yes! The milk makeup bronzer!!Yayyyy Sandra!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊💝💝💝Omg a new roll in!!! That's amazing congrats! Poor onesie...you hit pan on it quickly! Cant wait to see the next onsies you roll in 😉💟RIP to that onezie! Really well done with that bronzer stick!! Great job with this update!Yay for rolling I’m a new product! 👏🏼:)That dip on the cream blush is so satisfying!Yes there are so many people doing this project, I love that but also wish I could watch all the videos. 😥Put the Super Shock shadow somewhere where you get ready that’s in the way. If it’s obvious and you have to move it to get ready or get other products you’ll probably remember to use it moreCongrats on your progress! I am living for your glow today ✨You've had such an amazing update. Amazing. I love the product's you have in here. Sad about the PF foundation.Wow I didn't even know that PF aren't cruelty free anymore. I am not exclusively CF yet but I do try to purchase CF as much as possible. Thanks for talking about that.Yay christina! The gorgeous cosmetics blush is beautiful ! 😂shuper shockYou doing really well in this project! I’m doing this one as well and I find that it makes it easier and more fun to use my cream products that would otherwise sit unused! 🤪🤩I love the pf healthy foundation too.  I wonder if they will make another foundation since it will be discontinued.  I sure hope so.   Its my holy grail one too.I am doing this project Penn as well but I have an updated my progress yet and I won’t lie I’m getting very discouraged lol I think I need to change my goals up a little bit one of the products I haven’t even used which is insane but I might film it tonight or tomorrow lol so we shall see if i change anythingI've always used supershocks a few times then forget I have them. I have some drying up or dried up in a drawer right now. lol I have 10 uses as a goal each month on this project. With a full face going too I figure that's a good goal. Congrats on using up the BB Cream!! I have to use up my Healthy Wear foundations this year. I LOVE it. I'm so sad they discontinued it, and now even more sad that they are no longer cruelty free. I'm super upset. I tried to review the last products I bought from their website and mentioned how they weren't cruelty free anymore and they denied my reviews... That's freaking shady. But seeing as how the parent company did this with WnW and handled it pretty much the same, I guess I'm not surprised. Oh well, time to find some new stuff to love!I have the pf foundation for this weeks shop my stash and I’ve been loving it! Good job having a roll in! 👏🏼👏🏼I’m bummed that PF isn’t cruelty free anymore.I’m so sad about the physician’s formula foundation because its the only foundation that has ever looked good on me at all. All other foundations and concealers looks super bad on me. So far the only other thing that has worked is the maybelline fit me loose powder pressed on my face without any other base has looked okay...Womp womp wohhhhhhhmp!!! 
Schuper shock shadow!! 🤣🤣🤣 I am the same way on saying that also, I say tooth paste instead of too faced 😝😝😝Yayyyyy!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🌻🌻🌻Very nice with the empty! And another foundation roll in! Enjoyed your update!Watching this while at work 🤗kinda shitty, BUT if it makes you feel better even if PF was still cruelty free i'm like 95% positive they're discontinuing that foundation anyways. i can never find it in stores anymore, and the few shades i have found were way too dark for me and on a steep discount. same deal on ulta's website. RIPYou have so wonderful lips, try to make an effort! ♥️yass a empty!You are on a roll with this Project Pan Christina love😍🤩❤️✨. Cammie Carter is expecting her baby girl, I’m so happy for her!I would love to try the chanel bronzer. Do you apply it before or after foundation? The lipstick is stunning too. I am so happy you're doing this❤Yay! Great choices! Thanks so much for joining us!You’re looking at the camera almost all the time! You’re doing a great job!!💕I love wearing that becca liquid highlighter under my foundation.Girl, I cannot believe you are about to have twins! 1. You look AMAZING!! I swear my entire pregnancy I never wore make, and you look so so stunning!!!!! I love your eyeshadow and lip color! And I can't not comment on how much I love you leopard print shirt...I mean LOVE LOVE LOVE leopard print anything and it looks great on you! Great update!!!!! You are absolutely beautiful!!!Nice update! Really loving your shirt!The becca liquid highlighter is nice mixed into foundations to give a healthy glow or as a primer. I finished the full size of pearl up that way. You can also lightly set it with a power highlighter on your no makeup days to help it last longer without losing the glow. The poured version is better on top of powders and foundation without taking coverage away, and is more of a cream then a liquid.You look gorgeous, Ashley! I love your eye look! You have lots of good usage. I bet you get to roll something new in next month. Love ya! TFS! ~ NonaSlowly but surely Ashley, you will get there. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, you will see the results soon enough. Just keep going and enjoying the products. Love from the UK XYou got this!! 🔥💪🎉🎊👯‍♀️Yayyyy Ashley!!! Your shirt is so stinking cute!!!! 😍😍I’ve ended up using my liquid highlighters mixed with my moisturiser and using it on my body. Just don’t use them otherwise.You are on such a roll with this Project Pan Ashley😍😍😍!I like to pick and chose out of my project pan products, otherwise I think I'd have more progress and actual pan. I think you're doing well, keep at it. 💟💟
Come on april 1st!!!!🌻🌻🌻🌻That nyx lipstick looks like it would be a good cream blush too! Good update!That lip color looks gorgeous on you! I can understand why it’s hard to pair with some eyeshadows though, but I guess you can pair it with more neutral looks. I don’t wear makeup when I stay home either, except sometimes eyeshadow since I actually enjoy applying that. But everything else I only bother with when I need to put a finished look together to go outBest of luck with your new job. I dont wear makeup if im not going anywhere either😂 i love the red liquid lip❤The lip colour is so bright and summery! It does seem like it would be hard to match considering the number of eyeshadows that you are working on. Good luck in the new job!!Good job finishing the foundation :)That lip butter will def. be done soon! Well done all around!I am so glad that this is your favorite project!!! Yay!Great update! Must feel really satisfying to finish up a cream blush!The Elf primer is VERY similar to the Tatcha one.I finished my full size silk canvas and I was soooooo excited!!! I am happy that you are feeling better!!!Yayyyyyy bye bye blush!!💜💜💜Girl........there is nothing "wuss" about you and your 6 million panning projects.  lol  I think we have all had bouts of sickness this year, glad you are feeling better.Great progress. I am sorry you were sick. Maybe you could put the broken foundation to Elf's palette? So that it is easier to use? :DYay for finishing thebalm Jovi cream blush gone! It's always exciting when there can be new products rolled in each updateI'm so impressed with your completion of that blush, but what's new. You are soooo good! I'm so excited to see how you go through that new concealer too! I have a full size one. ♥️Maybe mix that elf foundation with face moisturizer. That may helpI love this project, it is so much fun and a good reminder of how important it is to use us the makeup we buy. I am certainly guity of always wanting to get new stuff just for the sake of getting something new instead of using the things i already haveWell done on the progress! I saw your previous 2 updates, was wondering if there’s any specific reason as to why you are not cutting up the Too Faced packaging? I usually do it to get more product out :)Well done on rolling in 2 products, the dip in that channel bronzer is huge! I’m also excited to know how you feel about the ole henriksen Primer!I cut into all those tubes that look like the primer you showed (primers, foundations, etc...) and I get tons of product 👍😉I’m in love with your eye look...it’s on point!! 👌🏻😍❤️I heard that they have replaced the Chanel Bronzer with a similar product, but not that good unfortunately. I have the same as you have and I had it in this project aswell but my pan was quiet big so I replaced it. Think I´m gonna put it in again later this year. Good job with the primer!Every time I see your Chanel bronzer I want it. I might need to order it. Great job friend on your cream panning, I too might change my rules.The dip in that Chanel bronzer is insane!! I am so happy you are going to see it all the way through til you hit pan - I cannot wait to see when that is!!Your eye look is fire girl! And you are doing so well with your bronzer! You can tell you are making progress by the dip!I have Sea Siren too!!! It’s beautiful! I really need to use my Stila glitters too if they haven’t already dried up!!!😬“There’s some hair in there, but it’s from the brush. I’m not worried about it and neither should you” I felt that!😂Nice use on that bronzer. You are doing great rolling out some this timeYou are doing so so well Mariela. You are amazing with that chanel bronzer. 100 use is so hard so well done👏👏i love all your stila glitters and your look today is stunning ❤Congrats on finishing a full size primer!!! 💜Wow you you have used that Chanel bronzer so many time and still not pan!

I have since finished one and am working on my second one.Holy cow that liquid lip! Well done!Love this look 😍!Good job!Great progress on finishing up a gloss. An empty is an empty and now gives me more satisfaction than purchasing to be honest. Great job.I like you a lot!

💛1st!! Good morning beautiful 
💛💛How are you guys finding trying to pan cream products?You're making amazing progress 😁👏hahaha here for the project stayed for the singing 😆 loved your update you actually made some really great progress and the stila shadow isgorgeous!!Love that lipstick shade, it suits you well! Good progress this month Steph 💜I'm am really digging this eye look on you! It's so lovely and sultry. 😘

You're doing so well with everything!Your eyes are lovely here but the blush contour here!!😲😲🤩🤩😻
2 of stila glitters have gone bad on me...they're taunting me🤨🤨
You made some good progress!! I feel well accomplished with 13 uses of anything 😊
Yay random song🎶🎤🎶🎵💟💟Steph, how are you?! Have you fully recovered? I'm 3 weeks in and this morning I got temperature again😕. While it's summer outside😕😕 Wish you all the best! Hope you have a nice Easter. 💐🌸🍀They may not be everyday shades but you are rocking out those reds!7 grams in 1 month is crazy good! Lol! Keep it up, Beautiful! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHi Steph! Great video! I am currently watching your whole playlist and it is amazing how much you have improved your video skill. :) Good job! I love project panning and I do it at home as well to get the most out of my collection. Could you please do an update of your inventory? I have seen the video from last year (guess it was July 2019)and I am interested in knowing, how your numbers have changed within 12 months. Greetings from Germany ^^Loved this video Steph! Sad to hear about that Jelly shadow. I got one of the ones from beauty bay and when I got it it was COMPLETELY dried out.. it was cracking and everything 😂Wow, really great progress!💪🏻 and I love your eye look- such nice colours 😍 stay well and safe and calm! 💖☀️🤗I think your cp base and ss look stunning on you with your eye color when you’ve worn it on camera! Your making great progress love your top too!I swear every time I see you rocking a stila liquid shadow you reignite my desire to get more use out of mine. I know what I'm going to play with tomorrow and now I can't wait!No roll outs but you still made really good progress. My update is going up on Monday.I love your makeup look. You are doing so well. Hope you are doing well friend. 🥰🥰I'm still need to upload mine. I'm behind on editing. My mental status is "Lazy" and possibly depressed. I'm used to not going out, but now that I can't I think it's getting to me. I can't imagine how people used to going out all the time are managing mentally. You seem to be doing well. I love your cool toned lip color. I used to love the color tattoos. I had nearly all of them including some limited edition ones. I had to get rid of most of them as they dried up or I used them up. The Covergirl shadow stick in the lightest color makes a good base. I don't know if you have that over there. The Sigma shadow primer stick is also really good. I have yet to find a cruelty free pot that I like. NYX is a bit too emollient and I've heard the new elf eye primers are too dry. Maybe I'll try one when I get through some primers. ha haa. Hope you're staying safe as always. I'm doing ok, just need to get my videos up.That Stila shadow looks good on you!I just love that blouse on you !!! And I actually love my Stila glitter shadows even though they dry out too darn fast. Love seeing your smiling face, Steph!💖You’re making great progress. I love it when you sing. 😁Same day film and upload? You are dedicated! Nice progress despite everything going on. So surprising! Something is definitely up re that 7g though...bizarre!Great update Steph! 💕I love sponge application for cream highlighter. 7 grams is great!Did you weigh the Huda with the sleeve before and this time without? Great progress regardless!Hi you’re still making great progress🎉🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝💝You’re doing amazing..those colorpop shadows would be impossible for me and you’ve used each 13x..impressive!! LOVE when you start singing randomly hahah..I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned that but it makes my day! Thank you for sharing the progress and thanks for starting this project..I’ll have entertainment for days hahah..my watch later list is FULL of updates 😁❤️New subscriber!  Love your accent ❤️   Congrats on your progress!You did so well!! Hope you’re feeling okay!Yay! Well done!It would take me about 6 months to have that progress! 👏👏👏👏I love when you break into song!  You have a lovely voice. AND, you have some lovely progress on your products. Those Stila shadows are the 😈Nice job on the eyeshadow and polish! I am probably the only person that doesn’t have a super shock shadow in my project 😂.Nice job! Hair oils and hair products in general are soooo slow for me!Yayyy Fey!!! 💝💝💝You are doing so so well. 13g is amazing. You always have lovely nails so great call on the new product. Yaay❤You get snow and we got NONE this year!Nice update! I love your soft look here! Beautiful!I feel your pain with the putting on spring clothing just to see cold weather! :( lol❤️I use the colourpop with my finger and I love the way it looks and it’s easy to blend but yes at the end they start to break ! ✨☹️  love your update ! I have to film mine but I don’t feel I’m making any progress 😂That abh lipstick is so pretty.I’m boycotting the cold weather... already switched my closet to warm weather clothes.  So floral shirts with sandals it is... even if my toes freeze when I take my dog out.  Don’t care... there’s no going back!These videos are so helpful in the sense that it confirms to me how long a product lasts. Flower Beauty blush is $10 but sheesh it lasts a year! That’s worth it to me. TYFS❣️I wish it were snowing here! We are already in the 90s. Ughhhhhh! I hate the heat! Lol! You are doing so good, Tash, but I wouldn't expect any less from you, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ Nonathat’s such a great idea! I have colour pops highlighter in lunch money..I am going to mix it with one of my cloud paints tomorrow! Can’t wait to try it :)Good job! Hope all is well.I can’t believe you are having snow. And here I am complaining about a sunny cold windy day🤪 you are doing great and good idea mixing the ColourPop highlighter and cream blush.I need to be better about using spf everyday I’m horrible at doing so! Nice update 😊I love the beet shield!I use my supershock highlighter as a body highlight/shimmer products and it works beautifully. I will say it’s not the best facial highlight but it’s beautiful on the shoulders especially!You’re doing great!! Those highlighters especially..very impressive!!How dare the weather do it lolGreat creative use of the Lunch Money highlighter! 😊 You’re doing great! 💖So interesting that your ColourPop highlighter is so mushy. I am trying to pan one this year also. I use my finger to apply and mine does not move at all in the pan.I felt that intro 😂 we had a snowstorm yesterday 😅 and thanks for the tips about the colourpop highlight because I have a hard time to use mine.. good progress! 🥰i’m so mad that it is snowing 😔😂Snowing? Oh wow! Here in London is +20°C  today! 😅You are doing very well! That blush looks very pretty!You are doing so well 👏👏 the progress is great. Cream products are difficult. That super shock is moving along too❤Great progress! I need to try the beet shieldSnowing? It's going to be 79° today 😂Lol the beginning is so me
and... it’s snowing 😂Nice job! An empty! Wow that lip liner isn't big at all!I am loving this angle and today's look. Creams are so hard 😂 you are flying through it though. 🤗Yay for finishing the cream concealer!   The purple Colourpop eyeliner is a fun, pretty color.  It looks like you will be able to get through the lip liner quickly!Yay for an empty!! Love the new angle and you look amazing in purpleGreat job! Getting good usage is always great😃I wish I could do short and sweet too, but I talk too much. And then I have to edit out so much. LolCongrats on the empty, Jess! You look beautiful! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaNice job rolling in something new I did as well 😊You'll knock that new lip liner out of the water in no time!  :Dyay to a finished product and a new product rolled in! your makeup looks absolutely flawless, bronzey and gorgeous as always Steph!I always flatten the point to my lipsticks by using it to help me line my lips! Maybe that can help you! 💝💝🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉You look so bright and radiant- very summery. I love the earrings!!!💖💕☀️😍 And great progress!!!Those traps tho 💪Yay for rolling a new product in. I always later a cream product to change the undertone of a shadow or to change the shade a bit. It’s so much fun. You remind me of summer today.Way to go on that contour stick!I need to stop buying liquid shadows mine are drying up too 😕 yay for rolling in something new!Amazing job on that bronzer..Honestly, you did an amazing job with everything!! A usage goal for the shadow makes a lot of sense..might as well set yourself up for success. I’m excited to see your next update..Thanks for sharing!!😍 ohhhh clever pan idea 
I love these tags you do and panning videos ☺️❤️Way to finish that cream bronzer! Also, you look absolutely stunning in this video! I love that top with those earrings 💕That blush is beyond impressive! Great job all around!You have some challenging products you are doing well!Your progress is so good especially the liquid blush and the primer! I think next time you can probably roll something out!I love your eye makeup a lot. :) Great progress. :)You've done so well Steph. I think the goal on the new product is so reasonable👏Love your vids! 💖 There are some minor Echoes in your new room 🙂 You could bring in some pillows :) 💖💖💖Which one will win? LORAC or KVD. Leave it below!!KVDOmg using up that’s NARS Lip Lacquer pot is a lifetime achievement! Omg way to go using up that cream color base. I’m amazed by your progress! What do you use to apply your liquid blushes?Just came over from Mariela page because i seen your comment and i am here to stay love your personality. I am doing this project pan as well and I cannot believe that I am just editing update 1 lol i am always so behind on updating my YouTube family with project pans lolLove the lip on you! I got it as a gift for my aunt in March for her birthday (the Cruella one too) and she loves it.I am obsessed with nudes at the moment so my vote is for the Lorac LippyCongrats on two empties. Very exciting 🌷What ?! the Laura geller stick is new ?! so little product !!!I need to pan my laniege lip mask. I don’t even use it because I HATE potted lip products too. I don’t want to put my fingers in a pot or have to walk over to my brush section to get a lip brush. I’m lazy, I know. 🤣I have a Mac cream potted highlighter in shell and I thought I would love it, but I don’t. Maybe I just don’t know how to apply it but I feel like it lifts my foundation, and it’s kinda subtle. Soooo....meh.Use the KVD it’s a pretty pink for spring!!LOL the flying mars blush killed meI vote for Lorac ❤️Lorac!!!LoracLorac 👍Wow Alex. You are doing really well. Half of that blush used. Nice work. 
I think you should go with the KVD gloss.My update on this one has been basically a fail lol ! 😂 I feel like Creams are too hard ! I love to see your progress it inspires me Ale ❤️❤️ - going half of the bottle on the Nars blush is awesome I think next fall, winter you can finish it completely ! 🙌🏻🙌🏻 my vote goes to Lorac !I love the baseball hat and braids! ❤️ also I burst out laughing at throwing the nars orgasm blush! Hahahahaha 😂 omg that was hilarious!!I choked on a damn Cheez It when that stupid blush went flying. I can't. 😂The Kvd gloss will go so nicely with the Nars blush you choseKVD lipglossLoving your super casual look today! WOOHOOOO!!!  Look at that empty jar!! Two empties!!! YAY! BAHAHAHAHA Your poor blush went FLYING!Your progress is so good! And I bet you had.a party when the cheesea girl lip pot thing was done!Heck Yesssss for that lip potted lip product!

Love from the UK XYes i was about to say what about the twins😂😂 i am surprised you have progress and a video up considering 👏👏 you should count that as a massive victory.Progress is progress. You certainly have a good excuse! I'm impressed you even have a video up!I don’t have high hopes for my products during quarantine 🤣🤣🤣 it’s ok to not use things a lot like you thought you would!!Yayyyy 🎉🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝💝Are you rolling new products in once you’re done with any of them?I love this eyelook!use the other side, the thicker side of the concealer stick to apply product under your eyes, that way it will go down evenly and you won't be scratching your eyes.You are doing so good on that contour palette & that stick concealer! WOO HOO! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat progress! I dont usually dog stuff out. Progress in my super shock was hard bc the product kept relunninf for the sides 
👍🏽👍🏽🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻👏👏👏 you’re doing so good! Don´t dig out the concealer, better to go on to the next one 😉Please just use up the mini lip product, it is an easy win, you can do it :)You are doing so so well. I really want lunch money now. I always have 1 product that doesnt get attention. At least its out of your bag. I am also loving the blue.I’m loving the blue eyeshadow on you!! Great progress 😊I love this project too. So simple, so straightforward, so perfect! I really need to use my green corrector more. Thanks for the inspo.Still loving the blue!! I'm still doing blue looks, too!  I feel like you're my blue-eyed sister right now.  lolYou've been doing a great job!You are doing so well!! You are getting there and you have blue eyeshadow on!! I think it looks gorgeous on you!I know u hate blue eyeshadow but dang! It looks so beautiful on u! :DThe bunnies on your wall have me all, aww!Your eye look is gorgeous and your progress is amazing as cream products are so hard to use up. good luck with the lip item those are a nice formula but mien is like a deluxe size so I need to work my way up to it. I finished my first mini gloss ever this year and like yours it was just hanging out in my stash.You have such great progress this month. I’ve enjoyed watching you finish up so many products this year.I know it's late but I think I'll join this project. Not because I want to finish anything up but because I want to remember to use my cream productsGreat update Paula! I think if you focus on that liquid lip it should be gone in a week or two! 💕I really hope they do a 2.0 version if this project next year!  Your hair looks much fuller today. I like it a lot.  Nice progress on that Elf quad.That. Contour. Palette! Is soooooo satisfying! Good job!🎉🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝💝You're wearing blue today! We're totally going to sink a battleship 😉I always say I'm not going to dig out product but then I do anyway I just can't stop myself.Great progress... when you have an empty are you going to roll a new product in? XxxBeautiful eyeshadow look ❤ You finally convinced yourself to wear blue eyeshadow ? 😛Your eyeshadow is gorgeous today, what are you wearing? You should start working on the peach corrector in the duo once you are done with the current one, it might dry out with opening the package every day for the green one. If the stick concealer is getting hard to swipe on rub your finger on it and then apply it, works well for the Marc Jacobs stick concealerI really wanted to try that foundation... I’m so sad I cannot now.  I see you hitting major pan on the blush soon! Great update!the peaches in cream blush and telepathy supershock are so gorgeous 😻Great progress regardless. Hope you are staying sane ❣️ that note book is so cute!Good jub, that notebook is adorable🎉🎉🎉🎉The notebook...💕💕💕🐣Happy Easter my Friend🐰 Hope you are well💕Fantastic video😊What does mix well w the Clinique beyond perfecting foundation in your opinion? It is sometimes a bit too dry or mate for me. I love it because it helps cover my acne, but I Alsamaan have dry skin.I don't have any cream blush on my inventory. It is really hard to use on my face because it emphasizes my pores and acne scars. I tried once a liquid blush, but it didn't blend enough and just lifted up my foundation. So, I still stand on my blush powder as well.You're close ups are so relaxing because of the salt lamp for some reason, particularly the close up of you weighing the PF foundation. The cream blush is so aesthetically pleasing. Well done on all your progress.Omg Christina the notebook. The bloody notebook. I think im going to spontaneously combust. Congrats on panning a notebook😂❤💛👏i got my first super shock shadow last month and i've used it once and i hit pan in it 😂was not expecting thatWhat foundation are you wearing? Your makeup looks so good.Lol I Like Tooshies hahaYour background is 😍. Love HP! I recently decluttered my colour pop SS in DGAF. It’s such a pretty colour but it broke and the formula didn’t excite me. I also decluttered one of the SS highlighters. I feel like I need to retry these SS products in the future. The application is something I couldn’t figure out 🤷🏻‍♀️I love that telepathy shade! 😍 I need to try my colourpop highlight like you do, under the foundation. Especially flexitarian which is very intense. Great job overall!The pf foundation mixes well with perricone md no makeup foundation serum and nars sheer glowYou by far are the more interesting person I watch. I’m pretty sure we would be friends lol awesome update!Great progress on that highlighter. It’s been soooo long since I have owned one of them. I have been tempted then I see your progress and tell myself I don’t need it 😂You're doing pretty well. I'm good with lipsticks (bullets) because I do reapply a lot. I need to get my video up... I have two unedited videos one of which is this project... I think, despite normally being an inside person, the fact that I can't go out is getting to me. I'm not doing very well at hitting my 10 use a month goal. I do have the Healthy Wear in my full face TeamProjectPan. Well, 2 because I mix colors. Still sad about that. Hope you're well. I'm staying home and safe. Just gotta manage the mental part of it. lol. <3I always count baby pan. For me the size doesn't matter, so long as I'm hitting pan and rotating through products.I love the tapestry as the entire background. It looks so good. They should make that a wallpaper!Telepathy is such a pretty color! Nice update!but face melting is a lewkThank you for your video!  Btw cool poster on a wall! As an HP fan can I ask you where can I get similar? Thank you!I'm mixing physicians formula with misha bbcream, it's workin pretty well! 😁Staaaahp the notebook is the cutest thing in the worldlove your videos  😍😍You are making progress that's what counts girl. And it sounds like you enjoy all your products so that's good. If you us this like others are to get use out of our cp cream eyeshadows and get pan in them all then it would be a success right? Also you are doing really well with the highlight :)Love the name of this awesome Project Pan Partners In Cream Christina❤️✨. Happy Easter🐰🐣!Congrats on hitting goal on the colourpop Highlighter! Hope you are staying sane 💜You've made such great progress. I am loving the purple super shock and the product you rolled in from depop. Also, today's eyelook is stunning annnnd it matches your jumper.I'm excited to watch you finish that new roll in!That ss shadow is so pretty!!You're rocking this!

You are doing so so well👏I do love that highlight! Sooo pretty! Well done!such a nice makeup look !!! I don’t normally gravitate towards cool toned eyeshadow but I’m loving your eye lookAbsolutely stunning look❣️Great progress! That lip colour suits you so nicely!!

I forget cream highlighters too. 👏You are making great progress in the liner and highlighter and lipsticks take forever so you are doing awesome!

If you need to stop or take a break, it's all fine. Do what works for you and take care of yourself! Best wishes!I am so sorry that you are dealing with a lot of bad news. I also have received so much bad news in the last week and went through a lot in a short time that's unimaginable to be so i think that you should do what makes you comfortable and not feel pressure. If you want to stop, stop for a few months or continue then you do that. Id love to see a haul and tutorials. Whatever you can do that can make you feel okay right now. You poor thing. The highlighter looks so pretty, especially with your lovely skin❤Good job! I have never tried to repress a super shock formula. It does seem difficult. That foundation will def. be done soon!I do want to try that concealer that you finished. You are so going to finish that pencil 👏👏Your hair is just beyond beautiful, absolutely stunning. Ive never had to repress the supershock formula yet. Look at you go with that foundation. 👏That lipstick really suits you! Good progress this month! 🧡I have never seen someone finish a jumbo nyx pencil! I am excited to see you do it!So close with the lip products! I'm liking how this project has been the place to finish lip products that have a nubbin leftYou have a few that are so so close Linda. Well done 👏Im taking forever 😂It looks like you will have a few empties next update! Great job!You're so close on that lipstick! I'll be very surprised if you don't get it done next month. :) That pink looks great on you! :)great job on the balm!!! You've encouraged me to get back on the train with the balms I have!! I WAS going strong last fall then fell off! No one is surprised by that when we all try to pan too many products--right? Karol in MinnesotaHi 😊 first 💜 I have missed you!living for your summery vibes Kailee!!! I totally agree with brushes wasting products, also they get clumpy so need to get washed more often and we are not about that life 😂 !  oooooh that mask , love how u switched it up to fit what your skin needs!I would love to do a collab with you! I rarely ask anyone because I don't credit myself with being creative. lol :)Do a refresh if you need to! Make it work designers! :)Kailee! Your look is so cute! I love the pink from eyes to cheeks! BEAUTIFUL!Hope you had a great weekend Kailee..Thanks for the update"First of all, let's talk about the death of me," 😂 Yes! Take that hair cream out if it's not working for you. I wouldn't even bring it back in the winter if it's so not working for you. 

Hey, they've said from the beginning that you can make this project your own, so you do your food thing and make it a refresher if you want. It's not defeat! 🎉 Please don't beat yourself up lovely. 😘

Man, those paint pots are crazy deep and don't take much at all to get the job done. I think you'll definitely hit pan on that by the end of year. And you for sure gonna have that foundation done by the end of the year. 🙌

I love your honestly. It has a 6 month self life annnnnnnd I've had it 18. 😁 We all do that. No worries. Oh, that's such a good idea to use that mask as like a face wash since it dries you out so much. 

Put in all the gimme products you want! You have so many going on.Love your whole look in this video!! Beautiful!! You’re doing an amazing job!!I wish i could make progress like yours❤I wish we thought of quarterly refresh 😂You are just so a kind hearted person. What lovely things you said.I love your updates, Kailee! You always have progress, & it gives me hope that I will too one day. Lolololol! Love you! Happy Easter! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHi beautiful as always love your nails and Happy Easter 🐰Hey beautiful happy EasterHappy Easter Kailee!!! 💗💗💗👍🏼🐰🐣I was just setting all of my skincare project pan products aside to get ready to film a video 😊 this has inspired me even more.I have had a few vitamin c serums start to smell funny as they age as wellThat is such good going with the super shock shadows ✨Well done! 3 new pans!This is amazing. You might hit pan on the rest of your super shocks at this rate. Look at coconut wow. I couldn't wear it to work either but omg its gorgeous 😍😍The lip product on you here is absolutely beautiful Bettina.😍Great job panning!You inspired me to whip out my super shocks for awhile. All mine are hyper glittery - so now is a good time to wear them “to work” 😄Good progress Bettina.  I've tried using a Chi chi pot cream shadow thats quite an irridescent shimmer, absolutely beautiful.  However it creases horribly and looks so patchy within a few hours.  I need some tips to make it work, or I will have to toss it.I need to Remember to roll in the ss I’m this project yay for new roll ins!!Yay for rolling out product! You are doing good! Love that lip color! I don’t own any more super shock shadows. I had a lot years agonice video stay safe God bless our worldYou picked some great items! Thanks so much for joining us! I am excited to follow along!Fun video! :DNew pan and an empty! Nice job!I absolutely hate when packaging breaks! Ugh! That blush stick is very impressive! And 2 empties!I am sorry that I am so late! I promise to do better!Hi miss marissa it is jalyza don’t know if you remember me but hiThat NYX lipstick is going great! And adding in another lipstick! Wow!

I am ready  for the update.You’re making such good progress!What a pleasant surprise with that highlight stick! Well done!I am so late! Sorry Lori!love super shocks. 
this is different project pan and I like it. 
hugs and love.You are doing so good Lori1 I love it that you are falling in love with your products while doing this project. Love you! TFS! ~ NonaYour makeup looks so gorgeous today, you look like a barbie doll! Great update as always 😻I know Ive said this before, but I really like how you are doing this project!Gorgeous eye look !! And I had the same issues with the stila glitter and glows , they dry up so quickly for me it’s a shame, i realised though that the shimmer and glows from stila don’t dry out, they’re beautiful, they’re opaque metallic liquid shadows but they don’t have glitter in them like the glitter and glows but I’m happy that they don’t dry out. Those things are too expensive to only have a shelf life of like 1-2 months for meI don't love the super shock mattes either. I have a very orange shade in monkey business. I have been thinking about trying it as a blush under foundation, but we shall see. Great update!This project is so fun! I hope they bring it back next yearI love your eye makeup .It is so pretty.I use the inglot duraline to revive my stilla shadows and it works great!!You are doing so well. 
That cream blush especially looks so gorgeous 😍I think you are doing a great job!!! 🌸🌸🌸💛💛💛🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊wow you did so well on everything ! and the peonye blush is gorgeous🌸I love your videos jordana 🌸🌸🌸You are doing great. Amazing pan on that blush wow. Hope you are keeping safe 🌸🌸🌸You’re making great progress!Happy Thursday EveryoneOmg First PersonI'm loving this project 😁I wish death upon soooo many liners. LOL. Great job Amanda!Hey all you cool cats and kittens! LOLOLOL !!! Love it!I wish could find a drugstore foundation as a less expensive option.  I’m just not good with matching my skin tone.  I’ve ended up with too dark, too yellow...  I need store experts to help me.  I will have to give up some trash tv to watch the Tiger King!  Lol!This update is entirely too long.  LOL I like the new filming angle where we can see more of your books and novelties.  I'm going to have to try that foundation now that CoverGirl is CF.  What mascara are you going to try next?  Tiger King?  Do you like that?  I had no idea........BAHAHAHAHAHAI use primer so slowly! You are doing really well!Look at you go wow. You're video is in the playlist. Its so exciting getting to roll in new products. Thank you so much ❤Girl I think you are doing really good! Keep up your great work.Kudos to you doing this! I feel like I'm gonna unintentionally be doing a project pan because deliveries are delayed during this outbreak so I'm kinda forced to use products more than usual😂I am loving all the products that you rolled in. Anything that isnt a powder is perfect so that lip oil is all good. Do you apply your super shock eyeshadow with your finger?For cream blush i had the same problem. I put cream blush on my arm/hand and then i dab dab dab that sponge on my arm. I am all for rolling out things if it isnt working for any reason.I love you too girl❤❤❤😊🤗😘😍Awesome highlighter pan!Dont get discouraged babe
You got this!!
Panning is hard. I started earlier this year with a drawer full lol.Heyyy beautiful!!Hope the new picks work out for you looking forward to the next update! 😊Congrats on hitting pan in the highlighter. Best of luck with your new roll-ins! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHey Victoria, I give you credit for even attempting project pans. I know I would fail so I don’t even try. 😂 the super shock shadow is really nice. The NYX lippie is pretty. FW & stay safe.I’ve never done a project pan ever before! Kudos for you!Great update lovely 💕I use stipple brushes with the colourpop sticks. It seems to work well. Sometimes I use my creams under my foundation and then I use my teamm project pan items over it. My foundation is light to medium coverage so the creams do show up under the foundation enough.I need to do a project pan. I never finish anything 😂Post notifications on 🤩🙏🏽Loving your hair like this and you are making great progress!Oh wow that Tatcha product is so satisfyingly clean 😍 so is that elf palette ✨ I love seeing used up products.Great update!Hooray for an empty!!  HAHAHAHA I always want to use Alex's old channel name too. Can't wait to see more empties!Your whole look, especially that poppin eyeshadow, is amazing!!!! Yassss!!I love your eyelook! The green really suits youI heard that hard candy also has a dupe (to the Tacha primer) that’s more similar than the elf primer. It’s sold at Walmart.Your eyeshadow look is so vibrant and pretty!At my hospital, we're no longer allowed to wear makeup because they can't sanitize the masks with the UV light if they're "soiled" with makeup. Goodbye, panning goals.I'm curious to hear if you think the elf primer is a dupe for the tatcha one! Nice job!Emily Noel posted another drugstore dupe for the Tacha primer recently that she said was more similar than the Elf Poreless.First that eyeshadow 😍😍😍 it’s my fav color!  It’s looks amazing on you!! You are doing well with the products. Your hair has grown!The green shadow and nude lip 😍😍😍I used to watch your videos on the train home, and it reminds me of when things were normal. I wish I could go backDoing well! :)Love this makeup look on you! So fresh ❤️The lip colour suits you!Green looks good on you, I’m glad you liked the Tatcha primer I Hated it. My skin is just to oily for it but I love the elf one the Matte Putty.You did great job...maybe you could press the Anastasia one in the Elf pan  or in with the dark foundation ..xoYour eye look is awesome! And keep up the good work!Hi Rebecca! You always look so fresh!  I love the green shadow!Wow your hair has grown so much!You are one of tge few people I know that can slay a green eyelookOmg!!!! Your necklace is so cute!!!! May I ask where you got it??I can't believe you'll have to move again already! You're making good progress 😊Good job on hitting pan in your blush ! I think I saw someone else panning the kaja blush, and it went really quickly.You look so beautiful!I’m about to be a military spouse! I’m moving across the country to live with him.That lip looks so flattering on you!! I feel like we rarely see you in a red lip, you should defo wear it more oftenI'm fully captured by you panning that highlight. I want to see you finish it. You are doing so well! ❤️Your so much fun to watch, I enjoy your sense of humor. Panning ebbs and flows. Some months you know you rocked it and others feel laborious.Haha I am loving the notebook 😂 I 
know I grabbed on the main part... but I feel like a pretty notebook always helps my project pans... if it’s cute I’ll feel more motivated to reach for it and keep on top of things ... 🤷🏻‍♀️🙈 Anyone else? Please tell me I am not alone 🙈great job! i love those colourpop highlighters!Well done on all your juicy progress. I love the products you have in here. I would love to try that stamp blush. Happy almost 2 year anniversary ♥️Fellow military spouse here too! I'm not sure how I'm just learning this 🤯. Best of luck with the move! 😅Do you know of a dupe for the foundation?We always move every year or two because we end up in crappy rentals. 😬You look gorgeous!! And congrats on the blush pan. You’re doing so well!You look great with that lip color! Go you!!!Love your personalityGreat job with everything!🎉🎉🎉🌻🌻🌻
Ambition will be the death of us 🤣Great progress Christina! (Also in the lipstick <3 I'm happy to have pushed you. Maybe I should comment more often 😜)I hate moving. lol I feel for you. Great progress on your products. I see a difference in the lipstick from the pictures. I pretty much have to wear a lipstick every day to make significant progress depending on the formula.That foundation should actually have an expiration date written on it.Blush pan :) *happy dance* you are doing super well and lipstick takes forever so keep reapplying! Red is a good colour on you!Revenge is a dish best served cold means it's best to let things cool down before you get revenge, so they won't necessarily see it coming. LOLChristina: says she doesn’t want blush on her finger, the swatches another blush with her fingerYour makeup looks even prettier today! Especially the eyeloookWearing Telepathy today. Love it!I was legitimately hyped for you hitting pan on that blush so I thinkkkk we’re homies now! HahahA fellow military spouse.  I feel your pain on moving. I often moved my make up myselfPartners in Cream is amazing Christina love, you are fully gorgeous today🤩💖🔥💐😘xx!yay new pan!  You look great in red.great video hun you made loads of progress xxYou look lovely today💝!How are you finding trying to pan cream products compared to powders?Love your eye look today, Steph. 😍I am obsessed with cream concealer for cut creases, I agree it's so much more control!Your look amazing in this update! Hair, shirt, makeup, everything 😍I love that top! the coloring looks so nice on you! I always find yellow intimidating to wear, but love it on others! <3Good luck on that polish, I think I'm getting crazy trying to pan one lolAdd a bit of distilled water in the jelly shadow and it should be brand new formula wise!Look at you being all feisty with the eyeshadow and curly hair, im obsessed!! You look good girl! you are doing so well! Ps I have the same problem with my nails, I found for a while that putting on nailpolish somehow makes them break less? but im such a klutz that they chip fast 😆Love your hair! It has that grungy 90s look somehow. Finding it hard to do any panning this year, but I think this disintegrating into a slob will go away soon enough once I can get out againA great account I follow in Instagram - empties like my soul - revived her jelly much with water! Great name great tip 
Loving this project so thank you 🥳That nail polish is pretty :)OMG! you look sexy & fierce in your thumbnail! I love your make-up & hair! Your blouse is so pretty too.

You look so gorgeous!! I need you to pick out my shirts!! 🤣 yours are always so so cute!!!!Hair and makeup are bomb today! And if I put a nail polish in a pan I would be hate panning almost instantly I feel. I have a few but I rarely wear them maybe I should change that. Those still glitters are the bane of everyone's existence it seems...You are making solid progress in a lot of your items :)Hi you can pan the eyelinerI love having nail polish in projects! I think a good way to start getting into a nail painting routine is to do your nails just once a week, maybe on the weekend or something when you have a bit of extra time to sit down a paint them. :) Good luck!that capri highlighter is so pretty! great progress!Eyeshadows are the hardest thing for me to work on, I get bored of the same shadows.Oohhhh lala! I am living for the eyeshadow look and too today! ❤️❤️Beautiful look Steph! How are you now? I feel stronger every day! Walked up the stairs today in a normal tempo (not like a grandma😂). Can't you use the nail varnish on your toe nails? It would count and make it less difficult😁.I have to say I love that thumbnail!First I love your hair and makeup!!! Stunning! Woohoo for hitting your goal on 30 uses!! I noticed when I started to drink more water my nails didn’t peel anymore.😍😍Lovely to see your beautiful visage today 😂Ah, Blitzen still takes my breath away! So so pretty 😍Well done on all your progress, I love watching new roll-ins. Good luck with that nail polish, I'm sure you'll do great!Yeah 💅!  I understand the frustration with the Huda palette. It happens to me in panning too. 😅 Eye liner takes forever! I’ve been working on a little stub of a black eye liner for months!!! Good, reasonable goal on that one. 🙌🏻"Everything is hard" hahaha!!  Yes ma'am that is correct.  You are doing a great job though 😊😊great job!! your eye look is so pretty!!You look especially beautiful here!! That eyeliner you rolled in looks stunning! thanks for sharing!!You're looking stunning! And doing so well! ^_^Good luck with your nail polish. I hope you get through it quickly.Your hair is look fabulous today and I love that lipstick.Nice job Steph! You look beautiful too!I love the look today!! You look my update will be up late cuz ah i forgot it was update time 🤪Great eye makeup!Until this year, I hadn’t painted my nails in years. Putting nail polish/varnish in a project scares me too.Your hair is beautiful.Those two colors on your eyes together are stunning! Love the curls. I have fine hair and that's what my hair does next day 😂
I have a hard time with polish drying out my nails and then they crack and break because I have brittle nails. I've painted my toes more than normal with my green polish. I usually let it grow out 😂 but because it's in my big project I do more pedicures. That's helped a ton when I give my fingernails a break. Keep up the good work! I'm still lazy, but I have a nice couch to be lazy on. Gonna do an early birthday haul soon. Hope you're doing well. ❤️Omg. I would have never thought to pair the shades that you have on your eyes, but that look is gorgeous! Also, loving your hair curly. 😍

That makes sense to roll the Stila out for now. Don't overwhelm yourself. 

Do you think you could rehydrate the Jelly Much shadow with like an oil, eye primer, or like a spray of some sort? You're so going to have pan in that Huda cream highlighter by the time you use it 30 times I think. And you'll have pan on that Supershock shadow too. I can feel it!

Oh, all the luck to you with the eyeliner and the nail varnish! Those are products that I struggle to reach for too. You're making such good progress with everything!OOOoooh I never thought of making my own tinted lip balm. I may have to do that with a product from the once upon a pan project.I love both of their channels! This is such a fun project 😊You are always so sweet in your intro! Makes me blush! Also, it's so cool that you made a balm (despite the spam)! You will def. hit a goal next update!Oh rats!  I'd wondered what had happened with the lip gloss video.  Argh- spammers!!!Wear it with every lip color you put on. Thats what I do! you got this!!I know what you mean about liking more neutral colors but the color you are wearing is pretty on you!  I hate spam phone calls.  And sometimes when you block the number, they just call back from a different one.  I kept getting two different ones for a vehicle warranty and for health insurance.just came from your castor oil eyebrow video.. are you still using it? any updates?Haha I agree, we do need this back next year.  I have so many creams and liquids 🙈 you might have no roll-ins, but you have a great consistent progress on all your products ☺️
Ah gotta hate those Spam calls... they always find you at the worst time possible ....you are still doing well! i get so many spam calls argh!You need to put your phone into Do Not Disturb mode, or aeroplane mode when you film. :)Awww Jessica thank you so much. We did say when we were setting it up that we might go longer. ♥️ i cant believe that stupid spam call. I would love to see anything about frankening a bullet product cos ive no idea how to. I tried to and failed 😂 you've made great progress.Oh no for spam calls messing up vids’ it’s happens to me before 😅 loved seeing your update maybe next month you’ll have an empty!How frustrating that your phone stopped recording because of a spam phone call. Last year I was notified that my phone number was part of a class action lawsuit because of repeated spam calls. Just a couple of weeks ago the lawsuit finished up and I got a check in the mail for a whopping $12. 😂You are doing great...empties or no empties. I am sad I missed the lippie franken--dang phone! Lol! Love youuuuuuu! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaSo happy to see your lipbalm!Oh, I know, your other foundation is from your Roulette pan Collab !"Something you're afraid to pan" I think. Have you already started to have some colour ?I love empties! It makes ya feel so good! Lol! You are flying through products, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWoooow. Makeup is on point. Great job with your progress.jeeze, that jeffree star concealer really didn't last long!  definitely not worth the money!  i'm still on the hunt for a good cruelty free concealer anyways!  i've tried the elf lip scrub in mint and i didn't mind it actually but it was mostly because i liked the fact that it was a stick as opposed to in a tub!Great update! I'm sure the J* concealer is great but I get bit annoyed with brands that give you so little bit of product. That's why I haven't tried it and same goes to the UD All Nighter Concealer. At the same time Tarte and Too Faced have full coverage concealers that come in huge tube and will last almost a year on daily use. So when the price tag is bout the same, I go for the one where there's more product :DWell done on those empties. So satisfying!!Those empty tubes are soooo satisfying! Well done!Well done Dannie. You've a load of progress and empties. Wow👏👏i would love to try flower beauty.🥰😘😍I love using light bluish shades with browns and, like you, i love using them with peachy shades!You talking about the temperature and here in Tx, US we are dying of heat and have to wait until it cools down enough to go outside.Oh my God, I applaud you for filming with your husband present. I get so flustered when someone is around while I'm filming. Love the confidence!With all the projects that you are working on you are doing so amazing on your products im in awe!! Hope you're doing well, specially with you being back to work 💟Great sharing for likesYou guys are always so on point with the playlist. I am impressed. 

I have Special Delivery too! I actually love it with greys, pinks, and purples. Hopefully that helps! 

I think you're making good progress! We have all year and you're doing so well!I am not doing the total bust and I’m actually going to roll another product and again the next update. But tomorroe is last day of classes. And then finals next week and then I can focus on make up for a whileYou look beautiful even without makeup! You guys created a great project pan. I am so late on updating I still have to film update number two 😂😂I couldn’t help but watch the video game your husband was playing 😂😂 you got one done and that’s awesome!!That purple stila and super shock shadow would look great as a purple on inner half of the eye and the green on the other halfYayyyy!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉💝 I hope that you are doing well! I love seeing Beau in the background playing video games!! I can totally relate 🤣🤣Those Colorpop SSS are gorgeous colors! That minty color would match well with any neutrals, in my opinion. My obsession lately is pairing my Huda Mint Pastels palette with purples, I love the result!!!! Not sure if you would be comfortable with a colorful look like that, but maybe worth a try? Maybe you could even pair it with the lilacy Stila shade? Another option if you feel comfortable, I think it would be very seasonally appropriate to just wear it all over the lid & blown out/diffused a little in the crease. When I'm running late but wanting a pop of color, I usually will use a color as eyeliner, or as a pop in my inner corner. My skin is fair so if I feel like the color looks too harsh against my skin I'll lightly go over it with a highlighter. I think all your shadows would pair well with the ABH Norvina palette too.  
Overall I think you've made really great progress!! :) Don't be so hard on yourself, and don't feel bad if you need a break!Woohoo!!! Stick is done! 🥳 I have a gloss (different project) right at the point where your is. It’s a exciting to be that close to finishing, isn’t it? 🙌🏻I think the Mint green would go well with a matte brown in the outer corner of your eye or if you do a smoky eye as a pop of color like a halo eye... you could also use it as an eye liner.  I’m panning a lot right now too and a new project coming tomorrow.  But I love intros!😆. I think you are still doing an amazing job using your products.  💓Totally makes sense to have too much going on with multiple pans! I am only doing this one and a regular rolling project pan and wow it’s hard if you get new stuff or rediscover something else in your collection and your project gets a little ignored. How was your time outside in the nice weather?? We had a super cold day on Saturday. It was 40F in Pennsylvania. So unseasonal for us!It wasn’t boring - loving this project!🥳Great job on the empty!🙌🏼Glad your day was great to get out!! Making progress Dalin yay! I kept watching tv 😅This wasn't boring at all! Sometimes we just have too many products in projects and it only makes sense to take a step back rather than add more products into projects :)You’re doing so well! Don’t be discouraged. With you rate that you work through products, I’m certain that you’ll have great progress for next update as well! Love your videos ❤️❤️Congrats on the empty! You are doing great...espcially considering how many projects you have going on. Enjoy your day! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHi again 😃! I am so impressed by your progress in all your projects 👍👍👏👏👏👏! I have been using a mini Hola bronzer for months now and it's still going strong. I have hit pan in it, but it last and last. It is the only bronzer I have been using, so I don't dare to think how long a full size would last 🙉🙉🙉. How was it going back to work? My son is maybe going back to school this week, but we still don't know.  Well, take care and stay safe until next time 😘.I think your minty super shock would look so amazing as a topper on cool toned or matte browns. I also think that that green looks so good with silver or purple tones as well and you could use the still perhaps in combo that would be stunning! Look at it this way, you hit some goals and you can focus on moving some other things out so you feel refreshed again and you can always add more later. Its your project you make your rules!Ive also been overwhelmed with mostly my eye products I am panning at the moment.Oo I love Gypsy, it looks so beautiful 😍 
I do agree, project pans can get a bit overwhelming. But at the end of the day they are supposed to be fun, try not to beat yourself up about it, some months we have less progress than others and that is ok 🤷🏻‍♀️😊
Oh also that green would pair beautifully with neutrals. Also with some yellow in the crease if you don’t mind going a bit more colourful. Or with the green smudges all over the lid and a bit of silver either on the middle or the inner corner of the lid 😍You did great!! Well done  how do you stop your Stilah liquid eyeshadow from drying out??I totally agree with being overwhelmed with the amount of products in projects at the moment. I need to reduce the number of complexion products. I love the stila glitters and mint sss you have. Good call👏👏Hahahah i love that Bo is playing in the background haha i love it. Hi Bo🖐Love the mint green sss. I pair any colour with neutrals, I think this would look nice with golds and browns too, a part from the peach tones. Well done anyway on the progress ! Everyone seems to be completely stuffed with their projects, you're right: take a breather!You could try using that supershock on the inner third of your transition placement. Lauren Mae beauty often wears pink there, and I like to do yellow, this placements makes brighter ( not too dark) colors wearable.your blush look today is so pretty!!Thanks for sharing your update!! I’m so boring, I’d just do a neutral eye and smudge the colourpop on the lower lash line..I do love green shades on my lower lash line but I feel that’s a very safe way to use colour.It can be hard to not get overwhelmed when you start doing so many project pans. I totally understand what you're saying.Wise decision not to roll anything in to keep things fun for you. I would pair the Colourpop with pastels, use it on the lid with cool tones browns or use it as a bright inner corner with the mustard or olives from Subculture.Youv'e done so well specially with the cp highlighter!! Can't wait to see next months update!You've inspired me to work on my Flower Beauty blushes. I've also used your tip to mix the two shades together and I love it!  I look forward to this update every month ♡Def. steady progress! I enjoyed it!You are doing great!! I have been tempted to get another colourpop highlighter and then see updates like this and remind myself no lolgreat progress!! doesn’t the colourpop highlight contain 4.2gr, like the blushes??You always do great with your projects, Tash! I wish I could pan half as well as you do. Lol! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaKeep at it👏👏👏You have been doing great for the situation we are all in now! 💝 I cannot wait to see the headway that you make when this is all done! 💝💝You are doing so well! That Flower beauty blush looks so pretty. I just ordered one as they recently started selling in the UK and I am so excited 😍Good video. I have been subscribed for awhile. I just started a project pan and a 2 weeks one pallet on my channel. Care to check them out?you are doing so well on that flower blush!Great progress ! ❤️AMAZING!🥰Quarantine is the perfect time to pan thingsNice progress! 👍🏻You've made amazing progress. The colourpop highlighter progress is amazing. I am delighted you are doing this. I would love to try flower beauty.You are making great progress. Fringe looks stunning :O“On my single forehead, but both sides’ haha that cracked me up 😂
Oh I am the same. I have so many lipsticks, but I do so slow with them in projects 🙈 
Great progress ✨Loving your eyeshadow! Also, I love the shade fringe! Great update!You look gorgeous, Kali! I wouldn't want to wear make-up @ work either. Thank you for doing what you do! Keep up the good work! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI completely understand not wearing makeup at work.  And please know that so many of us appreciate the work that you do to help others!!You are doing a good job. You've got this!That BB cream sounds like it has some good progress! I am excited to see how you do with it! I hope you are  feeling better too!Congrats on the empty! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaDoing well Lori! :)You are doing really well! Good job Emelie. I am so impressed anytime anyone finishes a lip product!I think I saw someone else panning the YSL corrector, but they didn't like it. How did you use Telepathy ? Christina Chang is also panning it, and she mostly uses it as an inner corner.Great job with this update,  you're doing great ❣I am feeling this eyelook! Great progress!2 roll ins! Nice job! I am so excited to see you work on foundation. I love to watch people pan foundation!Great job rolling 2 new in. Never heard of those cream blushes before.Aww I love that L’Oréal foundation I think it looks really nice on my skin.. 😅 great job finishing stuff up! 👏🏼👏🏼💖💖💖I’m so sad that you don’t really like the L’Oréal foundation - that’s my drugstore go to!
I really enjoy the Covergirl concealer as well - I ended up grabbing one way too orange for me, so I’m currently panning it as an eyeshadow primer! When I go through some other concealers im definitely picking it up again in the correct shade 😊You look gorgeous as ever, Ioana! Congrats on rolling in 2 new products! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaOoo I love your eyeshadow look, so vibrant 😍 I love the idea of full face of cream products as well 👌🏻 
I like setting my cream blushes with a powder one as well, it helps with longevity a lot. 
You did so well 👍🏻Yay for 2 new products in 😊You've done brilliant with 2. Best of luck with the foundation. Good job👏Great job finishing the concealer and meeting your goal on the colourpop!! I agree about the foundation..kind of heavy and even slightly drying for my skin..hoping it works better in the summer. I’m excited to see how you do next month. Thanks for sharing!!Side pan!!! So nice! Great job!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉I am loving how comfy the Harry potter dressing gown looks. The tom ford cream blush looks stunning. You are doing so so well. You've such hard products and your progress is amazing.Hey guys!  How are you all doing with your project pan items?You are doing so well with this project!!! That balm palette alone is crazy, but your other items also have really good progress! WOW!Congrats on the empty! I'm always excited to see how you're doing with theBalm blush palette! I used to love that palette too. I just got the elf cream blush palette and I have really enjoyed it so far! :)My bite honeycomb is soooooo close to being done but I have been concentrating on panning my lip balms during quarantine lolHellooooo mr crisp 😍 I want that blush palette so badly! 😂How many times can you repeat yourself!? Shooooot how many times can I??? I need to take a shot every time I do 🤣🤣I want to try a drugstore cream bronzer that I heard about.. of course I don’t remember right now, but I will let you know if you want!I love your energy in all of your videos. great progress as always!You are making great progress look at that blush palette! You are brave rolling in a mini lipstick. I finished one recently and I felt like it was an achievement! Honeycomb makes me look at death warmed up but it looks amazing on you and that formula by bite is gorgeous! Only dye your hair if you know you won't hate the colour in a while as box dyes can be so hit or miss.I’m trying to pan a really old lip right now and it’s so hard. Last month I used it like 20 days and made no progress 🤦‍♀️. But good luck!It’s not a good idea, but I’m like “f” it! Do it!!Your self made cream shadow is so aesthetically pleasing wow. That blush palette is serious SERIOUS goals. Go you with the bite beauty. I've never tried them. Tell me. Is your hair red?😂♥️That pan on the balm blush palette is panning goals :)One of my products from the project went bad recently. I love your eye makeup on this video !gosh markings are tough, specially when I try to remember which marking is from when😆 Great progress as always StephYou're making great progress!!Which pore filling primers do you prefer?I always screw up marking 😂 this month was hard for me also cause of allergies. 😝That was my last summer...our entire sidewalk and road was redone. It took from May until September to finish. It sucked so bad bc I have a 3 & 5 year old so they couldn't really go play out front at all. But it does look super nice now and they can run down the sidewalk now without falling into holes 🤣You are so close on a couple of them!! Way to go!! Sorry about the construction..we don’t mind as viewers..but can’t imagine it’s very pleasant for you personally!!I'm sure you'll have some of those products used up by the next update :)You're doing really well! I have the mini Milk Bronzer in my project and I'm so mad the packaging broke. I can't roll it up anymore. I think I need to depot it into something. I use my creams in the reverse foundation technique too. That way I can use my team project pan items on top. It does look nice and subtle on its own though. I'm sure you can get through that lipstick! Keep it up!Happy Mother’s Day!! 💝🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️I think you are doing sooooo well! That primer, foundation, and that blush are insane! Very impressive!That liquid blush though that's impressive! I predict you can finish 2 or 3 for the next update I think it will be so satisfying to see that primer gone too as you can focus on ones you actually like! And it looks to me like you had a starting point then measured your progress by months I could be wrong but we can see your are using your stuff!Oh my gosh! So many products are SO close! 🙌
Happy Mothers Day again 😘🌷💕 and Happy belated birthday 🎂Haha seeing you getting confused with the remarking is such a project panner thing 😂 The amount of times I confuse myself with the marks 🙄🙈You have really reeeeeeally good progress. I would love to try the flower beauty blush. You'll have some empties next time. I am going to google what reverse foundation is.Loved this video!

For some reason i feel like your hair is blonder?🤔😍 the revlon stick looks gorgeous.Doing well! Lol, I feel ya on the progress. We always think the products will go faster than they are. You'll get there soon! :)Which one would you want to use? They both go bad, which is unfortunate! Chose which is the oldest OR the one that has the least amount of product!I don’t like my top coat from L.A. girl! It’s not thick at all like I like and it takes FOREVER to dry down and set my nailsI am the same way! My hair is super oily after one day, I have learned to put in dry shampoo a few hours after showering.!. Just giving myself a little volume as well!🎉🎉🥳🥳 I cannot believe this video just slipped past me!you are doing great! I am super impressed by your nail polishes! I am panning 2 in my 20 in 2020, and they are going soooo slow!I am having a really dry scap lately and oily hair too?you are making great progress so you are♥️Yaaay. I am living for your hair.great job with the 2 new roll ins!!! you did so awesome Sophie!! Cant wait for next months updateGirl you are doing so great with all of yours project pans! Since the pandemic, I wore makeup maybe 10 times😂
Btw, idk if it's a light, but you have silvrr gray cast on your templesthat colourpop super shock is so pretty oh my gosh! great progress!Very impressive update! I love seeing that empty pan in the sleek palette!!! So nice!Wow that Colourpop Fantasy shade is stunning 😍 you always do amazing with your panning progress!2 new roll ins is impressive! And I am excited for you to go full mermaid with your eyeshadows its going to be super fun! You have some crazy hard products in so you are making consistent progress!You have done exceptionally well this update 👏👏i am excited to see you wear the new supershock.🤗Omg Sofie. Your eyeshadow 😍😍I have a bunch of those tiny Stila shadows.  I was so disappointed to see how quickly they dried out, even if they had never been opened.  Enjoy yours!  I decided to roll one of mine into my Pan Those Eyeshadows so I have one in at all times.  Congrats on finishing your concealer!  :)Miss ya!Hooray for finishing a makeup item!! Isn't it crazy how long even mini liquid lipsticks can lasti want flexitarian too!!!Lunch money is also my favorite shade! It's soooo good! Flexitarian is good, but I LOVE lunch money!Yay you got to roll something new in!!That's such a pretty Stila Glitter 'n Glow.  You said you didn't think you were helping yourself by adding another eye product, but... lol... you know... lol... I actually put the Glitter 'n Glows on top of my powder shadows just to give it a different look.  I don't think it's a situation of using either/or unless you want to.  You can use both together.  😊That Stila is so lovely, I could paint my walls with it.I thought you finished that ELF cream palette. I already partied for you in my head. Haha 🥳🤩🥳👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❣️❣️❣️❣️Nice update Paula!! Yay for a new roll in!Yay for finishing another product and rolling in the Stila shadow! It looks like it is going to be fun to use, it’s a pretty color!You just keep chippin' away @ things, Paula! Congrats on getting to roll in a new product! Love you, Beautiful! Stay safe! Happy Mother's Day! TFS! ~ NonaGreat job! You are doing well on that COLOURPOP highlighter!Oh, that Stila shadow is delicious! I could look at that all day. Woohoo for the empty 🎉🎆🎉Yayyyy!!! So so happy to be doing this together!! 💝💝What about mixing some of your dug out concealer with that darkest shade in the elf paletteI love lunch money too. It's my perfect shade also, so we must have similar skin tones... or it's just a magical shade that works for many skin tones lol. I have smokin whistles in this project... I dont like it as much as lunch money but, spoiler alert, I hit pan this month... so I gotta do my updateFlexitarian is incredibly white. It’s beautiful but I feel that it’s only good for the very fair skinned.Great progress!Nice progress this month. You seem so pleased with your products. I love that!You should start working on the darkest shade in the quad once you get a tan, it looks like it would be hard to work on during winter. I’m so glad you put the Stila glitter in this project, you can layer it on top of so many eyeshadows to bring something extra. You can even layer it on top of the black or other dark eyeshadows.that stilla glitter is what you hoped your mac platinum pigment were but wasn't, methinks.Yay for meeting your goals on two products!You are doing so well Paula. Id love to try a green colour corrector. That stila product looks absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to see it on you. I wonder smoke n whistles be too dark for me? Great job♥️Youre doing great!Great update Jocelyn, sooo darn close with the lipstick lol I can't wait to see it empty next month!!Great job. Have fun playing with makeup. It’s always fun to try new thingsAn empty! Well done! You will def. finish that concealer and lipstick soon too!Yaaay for the foundation. Well done to you. I love having supershocks in but then forgetting about it is so easy haha.I just rolled a super shock into my Pan Those Shadows and I have a feeling I’m going to completely forget about it 🙈 

Congrats on another empty! I think you’ll have that lipstick done by next update 😊Girl that lipstick! My only empty for my project pan this month thus far has been a mini lipstick and I am so happy to have used one up so you got this! I think you can totally finish the lipstick and the concealer. It will be so cool to be able to roll those things out and yay for finally finishing that foundation its so satisfying to finish things!yay! you are doing well! i never reach for single pot eyeshadows sadly!🥳🥳🥳I felt like that cover fx foundation was just gonna live in the background of your videos forever lol.You did well with your items.  You should check into getting a set of makeup spatulas so that you can get to the bottom of your products.  I am pretty sure that you can find them on Amazon.yay for the cover FX foundation empty! You can totally finish that lipstick.I smiled so big when you said it was your favorite!!! YAY!!!! Really nice job overall!Girl I applaud your dedication ❣
The never ending blush that I keep hate-using has the audacity to still have whole pan. This shizzz should have reached pan ages ago and it just doesn't  ! It has a dip the size of a Great Canyon and still mocks me so... I think that my Bell cream blush (polish drugstore makeup brand) got some inspo from your Nars !
If I had more cream products to use up I would chuck'em all into the bin.What an excellent update. You made so much progress and when you mentioned the total grams that you used i was shocked. You must of worn more than you thought.👏👏Woooooooo 702👏👏👏First 🎉Great update and beautiful eyes today 🌻🌻🌻
You'll definitely get that The Ordinary next time. I've actually started using more foundation lately bc I dont want it to expire 😂😂😂
I'm still looking for a base besides mac's soft ocher or painterly. Hoping to try gerard cosmetics soon.Great update as always Kailee!! I was actually really curious about the resurfacing mask and thinking of purchasing it!!I have been skipping foundation alot lately, Mac paint pot is still my favourite product I have as an eyeshadow baseCream products are tough! Any progress is good progress! The Estes Lauder foundation is really tough for me, need just a tiny bit each time. And the lack of a pump gets me hahaI enjoy hyper Kailee! :) I always enjoy your updates!This project is really hard. haha I love how hyper you are :) You are making great progress and you will definitely have that ordinary by next time :)Yay!

TFS! ~ Nona💗💗💗Happy Mother’s Day Kailee❤️!Happy fur baby Mother’s Day Kailee 💐🐶❣️I am for you and excited for your goal on the blush palette. Great update🤗Hooray for finishing a lipgloss! Did the smell turn on the Pacifica since it's a natural brand and older in your collection?Congrats on the empty! You are really good @ panning lippies, Beautiful! They are really hard for me to finish except for lip balms. Lol! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat job on the lip gloss!! How exciting!You are sooo good at lip products! I love watching you work on them! Nice update Katariina!You have great progress!!I used the e.l.f. cream blush palette this morning for the first time and after 4.5 hours of work it looks very soft and subtle. So far I like it...glad to see you're panning it this spring!Yay for finishing a lip product!!Well done, that's great progress. I'm looking forward to seeing how you get on with the cream blush palette xYou are doing so so well. You are going to have so many empties next month. Id love to be doing that well haha. Good job on repressing the supershock highlight.Keep it up!Wow that highlight is looking great!  You will def. have several empties next update! Bravo!Live-end isnt. But livened is  haha too cuteI love sea siren it's gorgeous! You've been doing so well!!Holy moly 104 uses and no pan?  Totally worth the money!  Nice that you can multitask as a moisturizer.Dang friend you are doing so well with that damn Chanel bronzer. I've looked for it but can't find it I wanna buy one.104!!!!! Insane! Well done!!! Nice job all around! I am excited to hear how you use diamond dust. I have it too, and it is the hardest shade for me to wear!And now I saw that you already wrote that down below 😅Unfortunately, they don’t make that Chanel bronzer anymore. They have kind of a simular product now with a new formula. Have the old one and Iike it, and have ´nt tried the new one but it doesn´t get that good reviews... Sad...Well done Mariela. I love your look here too. Its sooo flawless. I want to get that chanel bronzer. Im stuck between this and the tantour from huda beauty? 104 uses is mad but good to know. I have the ole henriksen primer so thank you for mentioning the moisturiser piece cos my brain didnt think of it😂♥️That Chanel bronzer has so much in there! Great job!I have been eyeing that Chanel bronzer! Good to know it’s worth the money🙌🏼Livened up.  ☺️💜Happy late Mother's day MarielaI never thought to try that primer as a moisturizer. That is actually really smart because it only has a six month shelf life I believe although i don’t throw away after the shelf life lmaoooThat stila shade is pretty!!!! Great update. You are look gorgeous as always.I’m always late on mine lol i think i only did update 1 lmao i need to film 2. Also your blush looks great i love it which one is it!?Love the updates 👌👌You are making great progress, Gorgeous! I really wanna get that Chanel bronzer. It looks so beautiful! Stay safe!

You poor poor thing. Thank you for such lovely words. It's slow moving for me too hahaGosh hope your rash is better!! Not being able to scratch is such a pet peeve! I always scratch my bug bites so much that they end up bleeding 🙃lol. Never the less great update !Progress is progress Ashley! Small or big... I've got the Becca Moonstone highlighter and I adore it (one of my favourites) but it's powder.
I'm so sorry to hear about your skin allergic reaction. I've suffered from them since early childhood (penicillin, insect bite, the sun, …) and they're upsetting and distressing. I do hope yours clears up quickly. Keep safe and healthy. Love from the UK XI am so sorry abt the rash. I have horrible skin allergies so I know how awful it is to have an itchy rash. Prayers. Just remember...all progress is good progress, Gorgeous! Love you! Stay safe! Hope the Girls are thriving! TFS! ~ NonaLove your videos Ashley, is always a joy to spend some time with you. You are so positive and send a good vibe. Hope everything gets better for you.😊🤗Me looking at your marker in the background and wishing I could point to it for you: 😫Hahahaha I love that he helped you clean!! 💝💝💝Oh no!!! So sorry for your allergic reaction!!!! That must be miserable!!!! I am for sure a scratcher, even if you tell me not to! “I wanna do what I want, you cannot tell me otherwise” 😂😂Yayyy Ashley!! 💝💝💝Look at all your progress. You are doing so well. I wonder is that smashbox primer any different to the one in the clear packaging?What a bummer that the primer is discontinued! That has happened with some of my favorite products too.You look gorgeous, Beth! Love that color on your eyes! You have good progress! Keep it up! Love ya! Stay safe!

Absolutely heart breaking. 
I hope you feel better soon, and I will be thinking and praying for you and your family and friends.niceI like to use my cream products the same way! I think it looks very natural! I had trouble marking my stila shadows. I moved to tracking uses instead, and I am much happier. Enjoyed your update!Also, I got the Colourpop lite stix in Uoeno which is one of the few without the glitter and is instead super smoothI def have not been doing well with my products because I'm not wearing makeup every day anymore lol. You do the reverse foundation technique!
Also I like yellow bronzers because I definitely tan like a rotisserie chicken lol I become goldenThat Too Faced palette is coming along nicely!You're so close on flexitarian! Well done over all!I was wondering what was on your eyes an all haha it is gorgeous. You can definitely get through those supershocks. Do you use your finger or a brush?Great job rolling in 2 more products. I remember nillionaire. I would wear it when I had a tan.This is so good. It's made me realise how many cream products I have! They are definitely a weakness of mine 😬 great progress! 😁You made amazing progress! That first rolled in super shock shadows has such a pretty shift😍Sucks that you had a product go bad, but 2 roll-ins is really exciting!You pronounced my name correctly haha :) Steph Lyons sounds like Steff Lions. Peony looks stunning 😍Love to watching you grow! I'm always proud of you Babe!11.11 minute video? Make a wish to the panning Gods lol! Amazing progress as alwaysYour makeup is always so flawless! 💪🏻🦵🏻💄😂You did awesome! Naked lol 🤭🧴Always nice to see your beautiful face. Congrats on rolling two new products in🎉🧜🏻‍♀️🧜🏻‍♂️Great job! 🚹🚹Woohoo. You rolled in 2 products. Loving your makeup look 😍😍 
🧖🏻‍♀️ naked lolNaked 🎨 remember that eyeshadow? *wink wink*🥳🎉💝😈 couldn't think of anything for naked! HahaSiiii segunda en comentar🐥

(A naked chick, lol)Yes it's really important to me not to let my products/cosmetics go bad or expire.  A lot of $$ I spend so I try to keep track and use them.  Lol! You're doing great using yours up.You did great 👍🏻 Nat I love when I finish products 😆😆Very nice! 2 empties is very impressive! Nice job Nat!I has been taking Steph Lyons about 3 years to complete that cc foundation 🤣Yayyyy Nat!!! 🎉🎉🎉 💙Your doing great xxYayyy empties🥳🥳Hey Nat! You’re doing great! 🎉🙌🏼Woot! 2 empties! Woot! Also did you like that Becca primer. I've been looking at that one for a long long while.Three products rolled out. Rather  finished.  Great jobCongrats on finishing the concealer, Beautiful! You are doing great! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaNo need to apologize! I also need to apologize that it took me so long to comment. Sorry! Also, I can't help but comment about the American Gods book behind you! Love it!I am AWFUL at timely updates. Even on projects I created I'm pants. I dont think anyone minds when you post so dont beat yourself up if you're late a bit xxx we're just happy to watch them when they arrive (lol... she says that watching this about a week after you posted - I'm not even timely when it comes to watching vids) xxxI love your intro Amanda. You have some great progress. If i wasn't allowed to wear sunscreen i'd have to be airlifted out hahahAside for the hair could change, it looks like your hair has gotten longer too! I think why they don’t want people wearing sunscreen when swimming with the dolphins is the chemicals in the product getting on the water...😁😁😁 you're so funny. I posted this one late too and iij was so embarrassed as well. But...who..knows the date or day amymore??? 😋🥰😁😁
You had some good progressI like CoverGirl foundations. I am working on another one in my project pan. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat progress!You are doing great!I really like the gold/purple eyeshadow look! i never have thought to do. amatte purple in the crease because i didnt think it would add definition but it actually looks great :) i want to recreate it!That empty ELF palette is a thing of beauty. I bet you could use it to repress/Franken other face products - even make your own face palette!I agree on the expiration thing especially with creams and liquids. I’m so proud to not have many left with the exception of lip products.I love your eyelook😍Yay!  You finished your foundation palette!  🎉🎉🎉.It's so satisfying seeing that empty elf palette! Well done! 💜 And I definitely think you can have that concealer done next update!You always make me smile and want me to wear makeup💕Wow! Good job on that foundation palette.You really are one of my favourite panners! It’s so impressive how dedicated you are to working through product!Nice update.Keep smiling,  BLESSINGS LatinaSo beautiful, love the makeup look💕Yeah, for empty palette. Reminding me to finish some cream products as well.You are doing absolutely fantastic. Definitely more roll outs next time too. The Disney highlighter looks so pretty.Hahaha I love how honest you are with yourself! That is truly the curse of being a panner, you'd focus on project products more even though its gonna be easy to finish another products! Love all the shadows you have in this project, they're so summery and gorgeous!Great job hitting a couple of your goals!!! Thanks for sharing!!What a great update DaLin! Good idea to roll in that highlighter! :)Beautiful look with matching earrings, very cute! Well done!🥳🥳🥳
At least you know yourself well enough to know that you wouldn’t finish that lippie if you rolled it out 🤣The gloss looks empty!!😅Hello 😃! Great update once again 👏👏👏. How are you doing? I've been really busy, but hopefully I'll get some time to enjoy the sun this weekend 🌞. Do you have any plans for the summer? I will be staying at home since Norway still has closed the borders 😭. I have tickets to Florida in September, so I'm crossing my fingers that the world has gone back to some kind of normal by then 🤞🤞🤞. Take care 😘Ohhhhhhhh, that gloss is so close! Lol! Knock it out, Girl! Lol! Congrats on hitting 2 goals! You are doing so well with this project, Beautiful! Keep it up! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWell done! That new hightlighter is beautiful! I'm sure you will hit quite a few goals next month 😊You are absolutely killing it!!  Great update!I need to roll in some ss shadows I love that blue one you use I forgot name already lol nice update 🙂You are doing great. Wanderlust is my all time fav too!! I switched things up too. It’s the seasons that get meFinish that lipgloss! Also love that you really found yourself enjoying the green colour! I think you can finish the stila glitter you rolled in :) And what a fun highlight it kinda looks purply which is fun. Hopefully you can roll in a couple more next time :)You questioning why you rolled a liquid lipstick into this project is so relatable!  I often wonder what I was thinking when I put certain products into a project.  You are making amazing progress on your Stila glitter & glows.  The colors you have are gorgeous!  I should roll mine into this project as well before they dry out.Those Stila glitters are stunning! I've never seen those shades and you're making me want them so much!
I love using my liquid (& bullet) lipsticks as blushes, its just so easy to wear and lasts so long on the cheek!Nice progress Dahlin! You got me thinking about my CP Disney highlighters, 15 uses is amazing!Nice! I also am bad wearing lipstick and liquid lipstick when it starts to get hot. I just want to wear a gloss!You are smashing through items! 🎉 I'm so happy you found ways to enjoy the Special Delivery shade! Oooh. That Stila Glitter you rolled in is gorgeous.Excellent progress Dahlin! You are doing so well with those stilas!! My cruella highlight ALMOST got rolled in this month...but it was spared (for now) 😁💘The way I wish I had your face tjsjfjej love your videos!!! I’m going to have to try that liquid lip trick! I’ve been liking the Korean (?) lip trend of a deeper color in the center and blotted out towards the edges so I bet that trick would work great!Amazing job, as always!! That blush progress is insane!! ❤️I really like how you combine the products.  Great tips to learn from!Love your hair this color! You made great progressyou're progress on the wnw highlighter & cream blush is so impressive.Congrats on finishing the sunscreen & hitting goal on the lippie! You are almost done with that cream blush & the WNW liquid highlighter...so close! Lol! I think they will be empties next time! Good job, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYou are doing so great!! Those cream blushes are almost done.youve made such great progress!I'd never considered mixing cream blushes with anything before but that's such a good idea! I have a liquid blush and a liquid highlighter from NYX that I always forget to use but if I mixed them together I think they would be really pretty! <3If you end up cutting open the blush to get the product out you can probably mix it in the Colourpop container. Someone mentioned that there is still a lot of product left in that tube that is hard to squeeze out, so it might be worth a tryGreat progress! I really need to start working on my lip products they're not getting used at allThis is the update I look forward to the very most every month! I'm inspired by your progress on the flower blushes, it's awesome to see you get through them. I pulled my liquid blushes to the front of my collection and I've been enjoying mixes colors.you could squeeze everything that theres left of the blush and put it on your eyes, lips, n cheeksYou have really consistent progress! Well done! That blush is going to be done soon!!Very nice progress! I'm so floored by the use of that flower blush!! Grear work 💃🏽🦚Well done! I'm midst editing my update right now :)Great update Nat, loving your new hair do and back ground butterflies🦋Great update hun!  You are doing such a good jobYour hair looks so much darker short.

Nice update, hope you're having a great day :)Great Job on your cream project panning. Your using them up. i think you maybe able the finish up that cc cream by the end of this month. love the back ground.Yay you finished a nail polish!

Nice progress all around!You are on a roll with decluttering!You did great!You did so well ! I’m so bummed because I wanted to buy the Colourpop prance eyeliner last week when I placed an order because I know you love it, but it’s not on the Colourpop website anymore, I think they’ve discontinued it maybe because when something is not on their site I think it means discontinued , because usually if it’s just out of stock, it says it’s out of stock. I adore Colourpop but I feel like everytime I find a favourite shade of eyeshadow for example I always worry about running out because they always discontinue things randomly.You did really well. I'm always impressed when people declutter. I have attachment issues. 😅😅😅I really do enjoy the colourpop sss highlighters. They look so natural on the skin when blended out well!Your skin looks so fresh and dewy, love the lip color, eyeliner wings, and your earrings too!Great job on the concealer!! Love your earrings!you did so well!! great job on finishing off the concealer, for some reason I dont go through concealer at all!Wow, you've finished a butter gloss!?  Is the tube actually clear?Your makeup is stunning! And you keep rolling thing in and out you are doing well!I love your whole look. That concealer is expensive wow!Your earrings are gorgeous! Great progress as always!.08 oz is such a small amount! Still, it's an empty! Well done! 💜Ohhh this taupe look is ever yh thing! I've been layering cream and powder blush. Congrats on so much use and progress
🎈Congrats on the empty, Ioana! I go through foundations fairly quickly bc I have such a large face. Lol! You are so beautiful in that soft, neutral, glam look. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWoohoo!! Another one done! :D Good job! ^_^I didn’t have luck with that L’Oréal foundation too, it breaks down on me as well and unfortunately looks abit too textured compared to other foundation favourites, I feel like an outcast though because everyone else says it’s their holy grail lol.Love your makeup you should do more grwmI love the Supershock highlighters! Mine don’t dry out like the SS shadows.Your makeup looks gorgeous!I’m still sad you’re not a fan of the L’Oréal foundation I love it! Lol loving the update 😊Love the soft glam makeup today!!⭐️awesome video!Congrats on finishing the blush 🤗Look at you finishing 3 products specially a liquid blush!!! You did so well Steph!

So impressed! That empty blush! Wow! You did so well this update! 3 goals met!I love your eyeshadow😍😍😍Congrats on the red lipstick! I dont think Ive ever used that much red lipstick in my entire life 😆Yaaaay for empties!!  Seriously WOW on knocking out a red lipstick!  That is awesomeI am loving your look today. Well done on the progress 👏👏The colourpop shade is so pretty! I find that dark glitter and darkish glitter shades are quite tough to wear for me unless I want to do a smoky eye...Woahhhh your base looks sooo good!Your Eyes 💜😍Wow great update. That lip butter you brought in is beautiful. And of course I am loving your makeupThe eyelook is so beautiful! And I feel your pain I did somethings similar to your Chanel lipstick with my bite lip crayon and I finished it early in June after using it so so much in may. I am hoping that my other one now will go faster! The fit me concealer is in my year long project pan. Also jealous at how fast you finish lip products but I think having multiple to work on makes it harder for sure!You're so close with that Chanel lipstick! Well done overall!I've never been this early lolgirl yes! thank you for speaking out. I can see that was hard for you! i hope your family member is on the mend. You're in my thoughts! and so happy to see you back to filming and updates! <3You did a great job 💜The gloss is so satisfying!! I am so happy for you!! Congrats on the finishI hope your family member is doing well. I couldn’t have said it better than you did, we all need to educate ourselves.I felt the same way about the world too. I had to take that step back! I cry a lot too and I have felt that anger.

Congrats on 2 empties! Yes, the lip oil counts! Lol! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHow did you like that Vitamin C suspension (I HATED IT!)
and I can't believe you finished that lip gloss within a month thats amazing!My prayers to you and your family right now! Things in the world are absolutely insane right now and its extremely depressing, but its motivating such a great change, there's usually a plus side to every negative thing that happens at least, so just keep searching for the positives, I know it can be hard. 💕💕💕💕You have made great progress on your panning project. You seem very sad and distracted in this video and it sounds like you need some self care time. Hope your OK xxPuppies to the rescue and hubby as an afterthought. Can relate. 😂 Seriously though, I hope you're feeling better. 💕

I think the HA Sphere are some type of molecule that's supposed to help the vitamin C stay stable at a higher concentration. But I could be totally wrong. Don't quote me. 

Yes! A lipgloss down! 🎉 Hopefully we have figured out the culprit of your allergic reactions and they won't be happening anymore.I am sure all your subscribers understand. Family is the most important thing. I hope you are doing ok 💙JenOh Kailee Boo 😘😘😘😘
I even checked your channel
Prayers for YOU and your loved one
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
On the bright side tho...nice progress!!!!I'm so sorry that you are dealing with so much. I hope everything will get better for you soon. Much love Kailee! ❤️Girl, please tell me that you are no longer using whatever gave you not one but THREE negative reactions.Yaaaaay for completions!  I hope that your family member is okay and recovering  <3Love you Kailee, I missed you but I totally understand.Yay a lipgloss down! 🎉 omg I was wondering if you still had that... I feel the same as far as there are more important things...sending you warm hugs 💗Sending you a giant hug! This is a rough time for the World, but we will be ok as long as we all love each other and hold each other up.Here to see how you're doing with the blush palette! Yay for the new pan! Omg I always have dog hair all over my makeup. That's why I don't show my cream face palettes very closely :DSilly comment but the progress seems faster at the top of the highlighter stick because you're leveling out the dome shape! There's less product in the first cm than a cm later on. Idk if that makes sense lol.New pan in that palette! So exciting!"I got brave and rolled it all the way up" immediately regrets everything LOL

I can't believe how you've almost used up that blush palette - 2 months and 2 blushes? I feel like you could totally do it!I also own a black cat. Her name is Pam! I am always so impressed with your Apple palette and I think a new blush palette is genius! Great progress🍄🍄🍄⭐️You’ve only had the blush palette for a year and you’ve already finished four shades and have pan in the remaining two?!  😲 I am so impressed!!!You are doing so well with your highlight and bronzer! And I laughed so hard when you talked about the lipstick. It has taken me 6 months to finish one of the bite matte lip creams and I am nearing the end with another bite lip crayon and they both are bright colours so girl all the power to you! And I am so impressed by your blush palette dang! Also I hope you keep highlighting charities that is an amazing thing to do!I know! I have asked my husband to buy me the blush palette and he said that he searched high and low for it and it’s no where to be found 😤😭Oh yes, the perpetual animal hair! 🤣

Yes!!! You better be have!!I think highlighting a charity is a nice thing to do in your description box. I don’t know if you’ve ever watched Smokey glow but her description box also contains links to different resources and it’s no pressure to click on them, but they’re available if you’d like to. Keep up your good work, both with panning and life in general!Hiya new here! 🔔
I see some frnds here too🦄🦄
Congrats on finishing 2 polishes!! And wow the progress in that palette 💃🏽💃🏽
Nice work 
♥️🎈🦖Oh my!!! You are doing so well with the palette!! Are you hoping to use up the whole palette by the end of the year?The progress on that palette is sooo good! Well done!I had to Google what a cicada was lol. Im an Arizona native so the thought of being able to open windows right now isn't something I can relate to either. Love learning though!!I miss using my lunch money.. its sooo pretty. I'm.using smokin whistles atm and it's ok but a bit shiny/sparkly for me. Will finish it up but won't miss it. Lunch money however I will miss when it's gone xxx you're doing awesome. And I like your hair in a bun 😁Oh my days this is my third time trying to watch this... so tired atm every time I sit to watch this i fall asleep... here's for third time lucky lol xxxI love seeing those empty pans in that Elf concealer quad. I hope to someday see it totally empty. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI’m pretty sure there’s 25 year cicadas too!Great work on your products! I agree that this is a fantastic project.Will you repress/move the contours into the middle of the pans to make them easier to use? If you do you could maybe franken the colors to make them less redLove you, Paula! You're my favorite project panner, and I always get excited when I see you posted a video!! 😊❤Definitely steady progress! Well done Paula! ❤️The progress on the elf concealer is fab!
I'm amazed on how consistent you've been with your makeup use during lockdown. Well done ❤Such good progress. Omg my house I grew up in was the same! Don’t you just love summer rain and we have yet to get any cicadas. Summer hurry 🤞🏼🤞🏼When did Hazel get so big?!  She looks so grown up and her hair is so long!  You're making great progress on the ELF quad and the Colourpop highlighter.You already had 3 products finished? Wow, I didn't realize! That Elf concealer will be gone soon!I had a cream highlight that I didn't care much for and wanted it out of my collection quickly, so I started using it on my arms.  I really liked it- I didn't even realize I'd like a bit of glow on my arm.  It doesn't look nearly as nice when I've tried it with a powder highlighter- it has to be cream.  Just in case you want an idea to use up cream highlighter faster.  Or to use up a different cream highlighter that you perhaps don't love as much.  My daughters love doing it, too.  We all walk around with highlighted arms now.  That first highlight got used up quickly and now we're finishing up a sample sized highlighting liquid- it's our 4th liquid/cream highlighter we're using up by using our arms (yet we still have plenty more highlighting liquids/creams to go through... we may still never be done.  lol).VERY familiar with cicadas! Haven’t heard them in a long time though. We might be due for a return here in Dayton soon.Just finished 5.5 hours of home school, and I see a new video from Paula. Such a great way to chill out. :)Hi Hazel. Bye Hazel.Maybe the corrector is drying out and that’s why it fell out of the pan, if that is the case you should start working on the peach side soon. You should also roll in the Laura Gellar cream bronzer that’s drying out. I think you can rehydrate the Elf quad easily with a little bit of argan oil, but the Laura Gellar one might not mix as well with an oilI love your eyeshadow, it’s really really pretty. I’m so jealous, I feel like when I try to use color I look like a clown😂😂What is your foundation shade for the summer? I'm just having a hard time matching myself and I think we are similar skin tone, thank you!I am so happy that you are feeling a bit better. I am loving that your eyeshadow matches your top and also the hairstyle is b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l :) I am really for excited for the products you've rolled in.Congrats on rolling out 3 products! Can't wait to see the damage you do next month!Great progress, Alex! Also, your makeup in this video looks so awesome. Purple is such a good color for you.You look so pretty in purple! 💜💜You are doing great! The progress with the Nars blush is huge!Are you interested in doing a black owned makeup brands video? 💜What a great update!You are so beautiful Alex! I love the purple shirt and purple eyeshadow! 😍 great progress!!!Even though I have oily skin, I still like the look of cream products because they melt into the skin and usually look very natural.I hope your appetite is coming back and you feel better soon! ❤️ I haven’t been eating well the last week either because the whole week before my period my anxiety gets so high that it ruins my appetite, especially with the panic attacks. What’s happening in the world isn’t helping either. I started getting like this once Covid happened and now more sad stuff has happened. I’m going to make sure I have enough healthy snacks in stock for next month like coconut water yogurt, bone broth, fruits, veggies, nuts, etc. Sometimes it helps to eat small meals and snack a lot when we have an appetite. I feel better now and hungry again. 😁My glosses are stored lying down so I can't tell how much is left. What I'm doing now while I watch this is reorganizing so I can get my liquid lipsticks and glosses to stand up so I can maybe see a line of where they are at and also start marking them! It might give me lots of motivation to finish one if I see any that are almost there.I don’t do videos and I love panning and watching videos. I’m so happy I found your videos because you inspired me to use my MAC cream Color base before fou dation and I’m so happy and very close to completing it now. They had been sitting for toooooo long and I didn’t know what to do with it. Thank youI don’t do videos and I love panning and watching videos. I’m so happy I found your videos because you inspired me to use my MAC cream Color base before fou dation and I’m so happy and very close to completing it now. They had been sitting for toooooo long and I didn’t know what to do with it. Thank yougreat job on the lip products! i don't take gloss stoppers out either it's a mess :)Dang girl you’re doing so well!! Your rolling through those nars cream blushes! Nice! 👏🏼👏🏼Loving your vibe💕💕I feel like I always comment on that Nars blush, but dang...that's impressive! Nice update! So many new roll ins!LOVE the progress in this video! Congrats Alejandra! Can’t wait to see more progress in the next update! ❤️Your progress is insane you are doing so well! Your progress on your nars blushes is so good and its summer themed now :)Such a good update! I'm excited to see how you do with the new products :)Im doing really bad in this project. I don’t even have enough progress to show. It’s good to see your progress and get a little inspired AlexHi!! Just found your channel today from the “Most Likely” tag. This video is great!! A good reminder to continue to use what I have. Just started my channel a week and a half ago and happy to see other latinas with great personalities on here ☺️. I don’t find too many..The Marc Jacobs hightlight has a darker base, but they have the same shine. Good job on your concealer !Looking like a SNACK Ashley, and your bangs are all grown out! You're so close with moonstone, and congrats on the highlighter!!!Your hair looks so beautiful 😍 YAY for an empty concealer 🎉💕Congrats on finishing the concealer! I finished a CP one @ the beginning of the yr. I think you are doing great with everything considered. You look amazing & super thin! Love you more than 2 big busses! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYay! The concealer is done! 😊 Well done this month, especially with wearing less makeup!The Marc Jacobs shade is definitely a close shade match! Well done this month!🥳🎉💝
Omgggg finishing up a concealer!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉Omg! congrats on finishing that concealer! I am loving your lipstick today and that eye shadow...marc Jacob's vivid? 😋
Nice work!! Rolling, rolling, roling... keep them products rollin 😁😁So proud of you for finishing your concealor! Congrats & good luck on the rest of your project! ❤️Love it! What’s your skin undertone / foundation shade? I think we’re pretty similarYou are doing soo good!!Keep up the good work!That lipstick looks so good specially with your skin tone it really pops in the best ways possible! Amazing progress! Next month will be really fun since youll be able to roll in a new product!That lip color really flatters you! I’m obsessed with it.You are doing so so well. I find foundations slow too😊You're doing so great with all your products - steady progress is still progress!
I have been mixing my foundations, too, and its helped me get use and rotate them, but still allows me to get usage on ones in projects!I love this so much!!!, what’s the shade name of the L’Oréal lipstick??Looking like a GODDESS!!!!!I've been doing the same with blush. My favorite combo most days are the 2 in my HP project, seraphine botanicals guava butter topped with the Natasha Denona mini bloom blushI love how you say, “I try to keep it on the edge where it’s happiest.” ☺️ You’re precious.Don't know if it's a good tip for you but when my products are over the weight limits, I first weight the applicator then the bottle and add them. I do that until it's light enough.I never thought about putting a lipstick in the fridge or freezer to try and fix the shape! I may be living under a rock, but you have really great progress!!You look gorgeous, Christina! Good job on your progress! :)Woohoo pan in all of the super shocks!! I have been trying to do the same!!How do you find and use telepathy? I have a Natasha denona shadow that is the same shade (often mentioned as dupes) and I'm not sure how to pair it. I wear it over matte browns but the green in it definitely makes it not very daily wear friendly hahaGood progress. I'm panning my Colourpop Flexitarian super shock highlight. I hit pan a while ago and trying to use it up this year.I love your look in this video! The hair, the shirt, the makeup are just perfectmy loreal lipstick does that too :( i think it might just be the formulaCould you do a grwm using your project pan items💕Great progress! How often do u wear makeup these days? I'm doing my makeup almost everyday but my progress is going nowhere. So disappointing 😔On e you’re done with the Kaja blush I think the lipstick you have in the project would double nicely as a cream blushHave you tried weighing the foundation without the lid? Maybe that will reduce the weight to allow the scale to read it? 🤷‍♀️Love your look today. So preety! 👍really steady progress. Idk if the freezer might make the lipstick sweat? let us know. I'm thinking if you don't leave it in there too long it might be ok.If I didn’t have sooo many highlights/eyeshadows that work as highlights I would definitely pick up one of those super shock highlights. It looks so pretty and glowy on you 😊I just finish my physicians formula foundation, it weights 148,9 grams without the stopper 😅That Lipstick is pretty i love how its a she :)Your hair is so pretty wavy! And that highlight you are going to knock that one out before the end of the year :) I think the super shock will go well with the other colours you are panning too so added bonus!Great progress! I also flip my cushions over.  Maybe scrape the rest of your CP highlighter to one side?💓L'Oréal lipsticks are very fragile and they break very easily. Your best bet is to be put it in the refrigerator/freezer and be v careful while using it! I haven't had a single L'Oréal lipstick which hasn't broken on me 🤫The look after you said the tip part killed me lolYou're doing so well considering the situation, omg! Love from a fellow Leo 🥰🥰Loving your partners in Cream collab so much Christina love, you look absolutely flawless today🤩💗🔥💐😘xx!I love Telepathy! So sad I don't have it in my collection.. You did really well, I think that Colourpop highlighter is gonna be gone in just a couple of months 😊Well, that's surely the first time that I've seen a bottle of highlight break like this. Did you have a chance to use it at all before it broke ? Like was it brand new ? And because of this project I almost bought a cream blush the other day... but then I thought that first I should use a lipstick ti try it. But the ELF palette looks amazing on your skintone !You are doing well! Also, that peachy elf blush is so pretty!Oh wow! That highlight packaging!! Crazy!How strange that the bottle of liquid highlighter broke. I would have thrown it away too. Too messy & dangerous. I think you will have that Too Faced lippie finished by next update, Beautiful! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWhat?! That's so crazy about the highlighter breaking. Well, one product finished. 😂

I think you can definitely have that lipstick done by next month. I hate that you're getting tired of the shade. 

Omg. You're smashing through those cream palettes! 🎉that's so weird that highlighter broke, i hate faulty packaging!You are doing so well!! I hate it when a product breaks! It’s so unfortunate!! 😭Nice progress. LOL at every time I use it I hope it's the last... I have had my eye on those kinds of face palettes like the elf one but have yet to pull the trigger. This project keep me from buying those ASAP LOLabsolutely obsessed with your nails!!You are doing so so well Mariela. I can't believe you've used it 127 times. That says its worth the money to me.❤Omg 12.5k so so blessedGreat update Mariela, the dip is so deep in the channel bronzer it's crazy that there's no pan yet! I
I'm also doing this project and love it! I feel like im getting more into cream things because of it!I felt that with the “knock on wood” when you said your skin hasn’t been breaking out.
Every time I talk about my skin doing well, I swear it breaks out the next day 😂
You’re doing so well on this project!WOW! 127 times & still no pan. I would say that cream bronzer was worth the money you pd for it. Lol! Keep up the good work, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaLoving this soft glam look! You are doing really well! My diamond dust is the oldest in my collection, but I keep avoiding putting it in this project. I will probably roll it in next month.That dip in your Chanel bronzer is like a crater!!
I feel the same way about the glitter and glows, they definitely dry out faster than the shimmer and glows, but I have been mixing 1-2 drops of eye drops into the container before I use it and it seems to help with the drynessGreat progress girl!Always doing so well with this pans my friend. I keep thinking that TF is a primer and not the foundation.That's why I don't buy the Stila glitter and glows, it's crazy how fast they dry. Faster than any other cream of liquid product. What a shame because I absolutely love Stila products!Great job on that bronzer. That’s over 3 months of use!!You are doing great! Yay for no breakouts👍I like how simple this project is! Also, I can’t believe you have used the cream bronzer over 100 times with no pan! That’s a lot of product. Worth the price for sure!Your makeup looks really beautiful 💕 what is on your lips?Loved your contents😍 and your eye makeup is always on point❤❤❤Nice job! 2 items with pan! Also, we have a lot of similar SS shadows and Stila glitters!I am so excited that you are joining! You picked some awesome products to work on! Those jelly much shadows are interesting. I have never tried one. Good luck!Congrats on finishing a lipstick! That is awesome! I hate it when my nail polish chips right away. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI hate when my nail polish doesn't even last a day! You are doing really well! An empty lipstick! Well done!Have you tried mixing any of the colours? Using a lighter one to lighten up the darker ones?Youre doing so well with the lip palette!!! Great update xxYay! You did roll it out. :) So close on that eyeliner!I think that was a smart move to roll in a more Summer appropriate shade. I can't wait to see you wear it, Beautiful! Hope you are well! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYou're doing so good in this project!Nice progress!Coral lips look really good with pink, peach, and soft green eye looks, and this is truly the best time of the year for itYour eyeshadow is so fun! It's smart to roll in a more summer friendly shade! Well done!❤️Love that top on you. Great progress and that coral lip will look beautifulI bet that you could finish that lipstick!!! You got this! 💪You look so pretty in purple!!❤2 empties is really good! Well done! Also, I feel you on working on too many lip products! LOLKeep at it, enjoying your videosYour eyeshadow and those lashes!!! So pretty! Also, you are killing it!!!I love your eye look! It is stunning...the lippie too. Congrats on finishing 4 more items, Gorgeous! You are the panning Queen! Up there in my top 5 panners that I love to watch. Keep it up! Stay safe! TFS! ~ Nonawell done!  i have never tried the flower beauty foundation (it's a bit hard to get here- - at least where i live) but i've heard good things!  i've only tried the lip chubbies before.  i didn't know that too faced made that lip scrub!  it probably smells amazing!  i am currently working on finishing "candy necklace" from jeffree star but the one i will be working on next is peach popsicle and i am excited!Look at you go! 🎉 Four items finished! That's amazing.You are doing so well on this project.  You are really rocking all your projects. Way to goI didnt know morphe is not cruelty free. I only have two products from them... one I am actively panning, the other being the 35O palette which I have never really touched... perhaps a candidate for declutter. You're doing amazingly on this project. I love this project 🙂That last product sounds so odd. I hope you find a way to use it!Always avoid 'shat in' shadows on the eyes and the faceHello guys, please find some helpful links in the description box 🖤I completely understand, I have 2 paint pots in my projects and I am kicking myselfR.I.P. the beloved onesie! 💝New subscriber!

I have such wonderful memories of clinique makeup, that was all my tia used 🥰🥰1st!! (Suckas 😁😁😁😋)I just discovered your channel and i hope that everything is okay with you ! it’s been awhile since you posted and i’m just hoping you’re out the bospitalOh Scarlette, I am so sorry to see you unwell. I don't know what's going on, but I will be thinking about you and praying for you. I hope you get well soon!I hope they get it figured out soon so you can go home. I am so sorry you are going through this, Sweetie. That must be terribly painful. I can't imagine. How cool was it that you remembered the usage on your products so you could do your update from there. That is dedication! Lol! I am a digger outer too, especially for lip balms. Lol! Continued prayers & love sent your way. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaUr stunning Sarah, lets date and hold hands hahah Sorry im weird and a tart....MeowI hate that Stila mini packaging! It's awful! I enjoyed your update!Seems like you are doing well! Good update Carrie!I would love to have some sampleNever try any of cream cosmetics beforeWow what amazing progress. That revelation you had is super super exciting. I am so so complimented that its your favourite. Thank you so much😊Great job! Cream products are difficult to pan!I thought I said it last time, but the nars blush has a pumpI have the Nars liquid blush as well. Did you know there’s a pump under the lid?? Instead of twisting it, pull the lid right off 🤗What a project! I own so few cream products... a friend just sent me a Doll 10 cream blush and it’s fantastic! These Nars blushes are a bomb so much pigments!! 😆 BTW I sent you a message on IG... 😉That lipstick is so impressive! Fingers crossed for you that you have it done next update! Great update Linda!That milk pencil is so tiny, good for you to use every drop of it up!
I love the lip color youre wearing, looks great on you!Your look is really pretty today.  That lip color is so nice on youSmall progress is still progress. Btw, you look beautiful.👍🏾🍀Seems like next month will have at least 2 more empties in this project hooray!3 new pans is fantastic! Well done!You can rehydrate your Stila Glitter and Glows with eye drops. :) Doing well!Great video, love your project pan updates. 😊 I found that my large stila glitters dried out 3 years from me purchasing them. I have four that are 2 years old and they’re still going good. I tried rehydrating mine with saline solution and that worked pretty well, I’ve also used duraline like yourself, but saline costs nothing compared to duraline 😂 so sticking to that.Hi you did greatLove your eyeshadow look! Tutorial maybe?How are you guys finding trying to pan cream products as opposed to powders? I hope your week is going well.I just hit pan in my Super Shock blush in the color Prenup a few days ago for this project (I don’t film, just doing for makeup use up purposes).  I will probably hit pan in my Super Shock highlighter in On The Cusp maybe in September.  I have also accomplished the goal of ten uses in two Mary Kay cream shadows and have rolled in two super Shock shadows for ten uses each.  Shades are Banana Daiquiri and Three’s a Cloud.  Still waiting to hit pan on SS Wattles but am using it.  I am enjoying using my creams!  I love layering the cream products under powders for the cheeks!  Lots of staying power.  Apparently that is a stage makeup/drag makeup trick, too! LolYou look so so nice in red!! I hope that you have been feeling better!I think your nail polish was staying longer on our nails because it's textured. I have 3 nail polishes like this and they all stay really well. They're also a pain to get off lol I hope you're getting better !The new super shock you rolled in is sooo pretty!Ohh that grog super shock is so pretty 🤩I hope everything is all right and that soon you'll feel better!Yay! Great job on the supershock shadow. I hope you feel better soon ❤️❤️ you’re doing so well with the project!Congrats for hitting 2 goals, Gorgeous! Frog is stunning on the eyes. I hope you feel better soon, Sweetie. I will pray for you. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI hope you're feeling better! 😘 I missed your face. 

You did amazing this update! 🎉 Oooh. Frog is such a pretty shade. I'm interested to see if you like it as a topper shade or if it works as a standalone lid shade. Also, I think I saw that Makeup Revolution has some potted concealers.Yeah! So nice to see you! It’s amazing you have progress at all, given how you’ve been feeling! Two out two in? 🙌🏻 I hope you feel better soon, friend. 💐I cant believe you're STILL battling that virus! When will it just leave you alone!!?? Omg your phrases always get me 🤣
Juciy panual, "what do you call this color.... burn?" 

You made amazing progress! YOURE GOING TO ROLL SO MUCH OUT NEXT MONTH! You better start thinking what you're gonna put it now 😛Aww I hope you feel better Steph ❤️ The eyeliner is actually so gorgeous and goes with your eyes so well!!I hope you feel better soon! 💖 oh and you did very good, as always😊That is a gorgeous nail color and I love the red SSS from ColourPop. It’s beautiful, but you’d definitely have to be in a mood to wear it. I hope you’re able to get over your sickness for good real soon!Also I love frog! I need to roll mine in soon!Loving those neon nails! Great job!I hope you’re gonna feel better soon 😘
I also love the fact that you have started to include nail polishes 😊Supershock Panning Queen! You are doing really well, especially as you have been so unwell. I skipped updating this month so hopefully next month I'll have something to post.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I've been waiting for  your update, but I'm so so sorry you've been feeling ill :( well done this month! 😊It's really cool that you like to Franken items so much. I'm always so nervous to do it!You are so amazing at panning! Greetings from Romania!Yay congrats on finishing off the concealer😍I love seeing your dogs! They are so wonderfulGreat progress!The foundation would come off with your mask anyway. Wouldn't it be pointless? I would skip it.Panning a mini isn't cheating! It's one less thing in your collection, one less thing you feel guilty about not using, one less thing to choose between. 
I'm always so impressed with your dedication to using items in your project pans, and not straying away.You're doing so well! I'm not surprised but still! 😁 I can't imagine how odd it feels for you to not have finished a foundation yet this year. But you definitely have a good reason!Look at you!! Great job!! Your panning style is like mine. Easy with hard to keep momentum goingMary kay is so under hyped i would love to see someone do a full face and first reactions!! 
https://www.marykay.com/KBellmerIts nice to hear things about gratitude especially during this time. Did you do anything nice for someone this week or they for you? I went to the dentist and the receptionist went the extra mile to help so it wouldn't cost too much. Another one was nobody would let me out in traffic so one lady stopped and let me. I appreciated it.Awh well done hun! Great progressoh dang! That green nail color is beauuuuutiful! <3 I've always been skeptical of colourpop's Frog bc of exactly what you said...  but you're really talking me into it lol perhaps on my next SS order if it's still around I will pick that up!You're doing very good! The Huda cream bronzer looks wonderful and well loved, I think that if you keep it in the project all year long you may eventually use it upIt’s maybelliiiiiiine! I am the same way 🤣🤣Woohoo!!!! 💝💝💝💝 oh my!! You have been doing so well!! This has to be your best update yet!!!Look at you and all this nail polish! Love it! Loved your update as always Steph!You did so well Steph!! Loving the new nailpolishes you rolled in! and it matches your lilac look too!! Beautiful❤️WOO HOO! Congrats on hitting goal on 4 items! You are killing this project, Beautiful! I love your blouse. So pretty! I gave a Family with 2 y/o twin Girls an AC unit bc they didn't have one, & it gets over 100° here every day. It felt so good to see the little Girls smiling & playing in the cool room. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWow 4/5? That's amazing! Go you :D you look beautiful in the bluey shades btw xxxWow the nail varnish 🤩🤩 lookachta go 🐎🐎
3/8 ain't bad my frnd
I'm always so attracted to palettes like that Huda one. Face palettes 🦄🦄
🎶🎼🎙maybelline 🎵 😁😁😁You are doing so well and yes usage goals can be so satisfying once I started adding them in and doing tallies its fun and competitive at the same time. You are now wearing nail polish more than me I usually always have bare nails and yet I have a few nail polishes kicking around I need to use some of them!Amazing progress. I love the look today! And when you sang that maybelline ad 😍Amazing progress!!!You look so pretty! I love your entire look! 💝⭐️Check you out!  Goal in four items!  Such an amazing update. 😁You did well this update. I like the idea with the nail polish.I don't know how easily you can get E.L.F but their new pot shadow bases are nice. I have one and while it's a little dry feeling it's a great primer for my hooded eyes. Just another cf option to the Maybelline. You're doing so well! I feel like my half goals were pretty lofty. 😂Look at you blowing your own expectations out of the water with those nail polish! 
And your nails look amazing!!

I cant wait to hear your thoughts on the new polish! 

I swear you've been close to panual in that huda beauty highlight for what seems like months now! Does the product grow back!?!Look at you go...Dang!!!! You did do good. Also I couldn’t get over how tan you look. Loving the glow😊4 out of 5!? Steph that is fabulous!If you find your SSS get too dry, you can rehydrate them with Inglot Duraline. :) Mix a couple of drops in and stir it up. It'll be good for a couple of months. ^_^WOOHOO!! Look at you nailing those goals! Congrats! :D Your products are looking amazing!I am loving your whole look today!! You are doing amazing and love the nail polish!! Btw I love when you sing that maybelline ad. It makes me giggleWhat a fun top!!!First, something about your look today is stunning on you! I think it might be the light blue and cool-toned makeup. So pretty!! Second, you did amazing this month!!What the what?! You made goal on so many things! I'm so happy for you! 🎉 You're eye look today is so pretty. 😍 I am loving that Frog shade on you. Gorgeous. 

Your new Supershock Shadow is very pretty; such a lovely, light shade.The Lilac Battle Royale! That's a cracking idea. Your progress is amazing! And I agree- where did June go? It just vanished.AMAZING progress! I love the 'x used' goal instead of hitting pan or finishing it. This is definately a trick I will use in my projects! Good luck this month!I love when nail polish has noticeable use 🤩 Great Job as always!!Good job! !!! You look so pretty.  I love the blouse and it is matching perfectly with your eyelook . Keep going 😉😉😉Great job on everything! And good idea on the nail polish 👍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Woohoo look at that progress!! Great job 👏🏼👏🏼Awesome progress, it's such a feat getting cream blushes finished! If you truly do run out of things you want to pan naturally, try throwing in a lesser used lipstick to try as a cream blush, I'd love to hear how you work that into your routineAwww thank you so much Natasha :) I would love to try those flower beauty blushes. Foundations and lipsticks are also an option. Id love to be at that point. Well done, you are doing so so well.great progress!Such good steady progress!! Also, that's so great to hear that this project has been so successful for you!!Excellent update! I have been using my liquid lips as stains recently, and it has helped me be  wear them more frequently. I am always so impressed when I see your Wet n Wild Halo highlight excellent work my name twin ♥️🧚🏽‍♀️💃🏽Wow! I have that wet n wild highlighter, its gonna last me forever 🤦‍♀️Maybe roll in a foundation? Expand the project to creams and liquids?yay more emptiesMaybe you can mix the lipsticks together so the liquid is more moisturizing for summer? And not super matte.great progress! Some liquid lips may be able to be a blush or eyeshadow. In case you get bored of using it on your lips.Making great progress almost done with a few!You are killing this project, Gorgeous! I love your updates. They are never boring & always have great progress. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI'm trying to finish a lipstick from lime crime, I don't like it on my lips so cream blush it is!Queen of panning! You’ve inspired me to play with more of my great products with this series. 
Hope you’re safe & well gorgeous xWonderful progress as always!! It's been so successful, and cream products are really having a renaissance this year. So a bit of room for new products maybe!? 😉 Hee, hee, hee. Btw do you remermber the name of that Ulta tool? I tried looking for it on the Ulta website, but I didn't see an item that looked like that upon first glance.Or two rather, even better!!!You are so sweet to comment in every video ❤️ What a cute intro picture 😊 Great with a empty lip product done for you too 😉You should definitely count that as an empty, liquid lipsticks are so hard to actual finish!! Great job on the other products too!!I had to get more of a scratchy brush to hit pan in my villains highlight! It helped my so much!Yayyy DaLin!! 🥳🎉💝Girl that is as empty as anything!What a successful UPDATE! woo! that lipstick is definitely an empty! no one wants to deal with messy packaging, one of my lotions also did that the other day and its driving me crazyyyHappy anniversary to you and Bo🥂 🎉🎉 did you whip out the gold palette?? I LOVE the yellow look and the super cool intro. Well done on your empties. I love seeing progress on supershocks. I totally would count that liquid lipstick as a full on empty❤💚Oh I debated my cruella h/l but I rolled in my Jades H/L instead! 🤩🤩
My stila glitters are haunting me 😁😁😁😁
Great update.
Congrats!! And I loved your look today ♥️🐧🎈You are done with that lip when you get the packaging broken like that way to roll in 3 more! And this update snuck up I was like oh right there is more panning content now. Hope you enjoy your anniversary and have a good weekend!Hooray for finally finishing that etude house liquid lipstick! I tossed mine a lot earlier because the applicator was getting gross for me (I used it for a while, put it aside for months, started using it again and then thought about the sponge tip after a while lol) definitely count it as an empty! Also did you see the expiry date on the liquid lipstick? It's in all Korean cosmetics, it's usually in number form somewhere on the tube. Think for this item it was at the think tip of the tube.Woo hoo!  Great update 🎉Congrats on finishing 3 moreMy liquid lipstick in this project is at the same point as yours, except mine is not broken. I'm so tired of the lipstick by now, it's taking forever to finish. I would consider mine gone too if the packaging was broken like yours.You're doing amazing! What's the third item you're rolling in? 🥰Happy Anniversary, Beautiful! Congrats on getting to roll in 3 new items! Yes, the squeeze tube lippie counts as an empty! Lol! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI would definitely call the liquid lipstick done. I can’t believe I didn’t think of using a Q-tip to get the rest of a lip product out of the tube. 🤦🏻‍♀️. Thanks for the great tip and you have amazing progress!I think it's fine to stop with the lipstick. I mean it's broken and that means potential grossness. 😂 I can't believe you keep up with everyone's videos! Enjoy your anniversary!I didn’t even realize it was the 10th! I probably will skip this month because it went so fast and I barely wore make up!  Good luck with that super shock shadow turned blush or whatever it is 😂 it is so brightGreat update! I am so impressed by how you consistently work through products.Awwwwww happy anniversary!!!Girl, count that liquid lip as an empty!🎉I also have a couple stila shadows. How do you rehydrate then? I don’t want them to dry out and become unusable. I heard Inglot’s duraline is quite good to rehydrate makeup products but haven’t tried it.You are wearing that yellow eyeshadow well. It looks really pretty on you.Happy anniversary!!! Great job on that lip product. It cracked so it’s not your fault. You used that sucker up!Woohoo for the new roll ins!! I would of decluttered that lippie too! You used most of it anyways! Happy anniversary 💖💖Your video is 7:41. Steph's video is 7:40!🤩 Ooow, you've got your trendy intro! Love it. With my favorite song in it😊.Your eye makeup makes me want to pull out my Uh Huh Honey palette as well! You did amazing this month as alwaysYou and hubby enjoy your time together! Happy anniversary weekend! 💕

You're making amazing progress! And roll outs! That's always exciting. 🙌

Oh, definitely roll out that lipstick. No one has time for a mess like that.Hi DaLin! You are doing great! I never thought of using a colorful CP matte as a base great idea!👍🏼💕 have a great weekend!I’m using up my lip products slower this year too! I think the reason for me being slower is because I’m now focusing on using all of my lip products and not putting a lot of focus on a single one 😂I consider a product as finished when it's completely done or unusable. When packaging breaks like that, it's unusable. It's not worth the risk of bacterial growth and a compromised formula. So congrats on finishing your first LL! Enjoy your anniversary xThose Stila glitters are some of my favorite eyeshadows!I agree about the liquid lipstick. Don’t force yourself to use it if the packaging is already starting to break from using it up. Enjoy spending time with your hubby for your anniversary weekend! ❤️Yay! Great job! It’s sad when the Stila glitters start to get dry!Your makeup looks fab on this video - love your complexion and your eyeshadow 👍❤️148 :O It definitely is showing its worth the money. Well done Mariela on another successful update.Hahahaha yes, spf all of the timeYou’re doing great!What a great update! Also, 148!!! Good grief! So impressive!Whenever I think about buying the channel bronzer, I end up thinking who I should give it to in my will cos no way would I finish up such a huge tub!That bronzer is a beast! I have always wanted it. You are doing so well! Keep it up! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYes ma'am! Free or not getcher moneysworth! 🌝♥️🎈🐧Will you do your June buys? Also I’ve always wanted to try that Chanel bronzer it’s crazy that you’ve used it 148 times and still no pan definitely worth it 😩I swear every update I think you're going to hit pan in that bronzer and it just. keeps. going.

At least at the price point you REALLY get your money's worth out of it!148 uses on the chanel bronzer! Wow! I'd say you are definitely getting your money worth and I love it!Ohhh I love a bonus video. Dang friend 3 videos in a row. Love seeing all your progress.I have always wanted that bronzer but knew it lasted forever. Now that they changed formula I won’t. You are doing great!! Woohoo!! 🥳🥳Your makeup looks so pretty ❤Omg that bronzer!!! I feel like you could use that bronzer for life haha. Great picks girl!I loved that stila liquid glitter✨✨ it is the best affordable liquid glitter I bought one for a try and I just love that💕💕Excited that my cream collection is shrinking!! How are you guys doing with yours?You look younger with your hairband❤ Still gorgeous as always.Look at you go Alex. That stila product is almost done.Good use girl! I unfortunately had to throw away my pf liquid blush because it turned bad 😢. But that’s my bad. Congrats on using the blush!That stila highlight has such good progress!!! Very impressive!😍😍You look very cute and girly with the hair and this makeup🤗I buy bot do do not like using cream products 🤣 Good job👍👍👍How are you? You look so tierd!💕 take care😊Completely agree about glosses!! Great job as always!!  😊😊That Stila highlighter progress is so impressive!!You’re doing well Alex! I’ve also stopped wearing gloss and even bullet lipsticks since a while now. Whenever I do my lips, it’s either a matte transfer proof liquid lipstick or just a lip liner which stays putLoving the progress!!This project pan has been the hardest of my life 😂 I don’t see progress I don’t use creams basically so it’s been an eye opener for sure !!!Yay! Great job! I can’t standing getting my hair in my gloss!Great update as always Alex.Making great progress 💖 Hope everything is well with you girly!You're close to 10k subscribers!I can’t remember but I think I gave that Nars tint blush to my cousin!! Kinda kicking myself because I love the color. But I have the powder blush and I knew I wasn’t going to use the liquid one. Looks good on you!! Xofab video!! 😌Adore your look in this video. May I please know what lipstick you're wearing? Feel like I've been asking this a lot lately. :D 

Great progress as always!Congratulations on all of your progress! You are doing a great job.  I'm also really loving your eye look.wow what a great update!! I actually love using the colourpop liquid lipsticks as cream blush too!Love the bloopers!!!! :)That purple SS shadow is so pretty! Great update as always!!!Love the purple shimmer you are wearing 😍Your progress is so good as usual! I am like you in that I am not a gloss person but I have managed to finish a mini gloss and working on a full size one and they take a while to finish! I am also trying to finish the maybelline concealer its super light so removing the stopper is probably next for me I am looking forward to it being gone! Good luck on the benefit products they seem hard to pan!Doing well! Your updates are as disorganised as mine. lol.The bloopers are so funny 🤣🤣🤣You look very lovely!! I love the gold and berry tones!!Wow that cover fx palette has great progress! That's awesome that it works as foundation! Great update Hélène!I really enjoyed hearing the maths because 35% in one month is so exciting. You can really see that cover fx quads progress in those pictures. You are on a roll in all your projects 👏👏The colour combination in this video is so amazing: the eye look, the nails, the lipstick 😍😍😍An empty foundation! 3 roll ins! Yay! Great update! Also, your base makeup is so beautiful! The perfect summer glow!The eyeshadow looks so pretty! What eyeliner do you use? I recently got into eyeliner but i don’t have a good one.Beautiful eye look!!Great update. Congrats on your empty. I am loving today's look! Nice work♥️🎈💃🏽Love your makeup 💜💞Actually despite the stated weight on the nyx butter glosses, I got through tiramisu and Madeline surprisingly fast. I think the applicator pulls up a lot of product so consistent reapplication used quite a bit. Yay on an empty!Nice update. I have that Touch in So many primer, I like the product dont care for the smell 😵Yaaay for empties!!I love your nails & that bright pop in your inner corner. Congrats on finishing a foundation, Ioana! I think I would love that Becca foundation, sadly I didn't get it in Boxy Charm even tho I chose it. Stay safe! TFS! ~ Nona3 roll outs is amazing and one is an empty! 🎉 What's your holy grail foundation? I'm just curious. Unofficial Boxycharm project pan. 😂 Good roll ins though!I really love your makeup color combo today it’s very pretty! What are you wearing? Great update wow three roll ins?! 👏🏼👏🏼I adore your eye look. I would love a tutorial or GRWM using it.Your eye look is so beautiful!! I would love to see a little GRWM recreating the look 💜I use two primers everyday. If you enjoy the look, then go for it!Very Interesting 💕🌞🌹LIKEI just used up the maybelline superstay foundation and I wouldn’t buy it again it was too cakey but I am stubborn and I wanted to use it up 😆I am oily/combo as well! What is your holy grail foundation? I love Maybelline fit me!I don’t think that I have ever told you this, but I always love your style of tops!! They are always so chic (Hahahaha!! No wonder, chic geek! 😂)Beautiful eye look!  I especially love how you did the inner corner.  I haven’t started using my Becca foundation from Boxycharm yet and I’m bummed to hear it’s so full coverage. I prefer medium coverage. Thanks for the tips on how to make it work once I start using it.Maybe mix that Becca foundation with your face moisturizer. That’s what I have done with high coverage foundation. You did great with this update.I wonder if you could make a mixture of the Touch in Sol glass skin and the foundation to make a more comfortable formula. Amazing progress!Was horrified because I saw your video in the home page of the app but not the inbox and then realised the bell wasn't set to all?!
A travesty. I have since corrected it (it's past one am here in the UK and for some reason I am feeling wide awake and very dramatic and overly British madness is happening in my brain)

In other news, I LOVE the eye makeup and please I need your skills. And I'm loving the regular updates.

Christ I'm never going to fall asleep tonight and then I'll be a zombie tomorrow.

Edit: do you have tips for using liquid/cream products on top of/with other products like foundation?I have that Becca foundation from Boxy as well. I hate it. 😂 You're doing well!Your eye look is so interesting. I found myself staring at it instead of listening to you speak.Your nail color is so pretty 💞💞Great progress. Love your project pan videos.fab video! 😌✨I need to comment more on this channel. Idk why I don't. Just liking it isn't enough. I feel like a c***. How you been nana's?That’s how the highlight crumbles 🤣🤣So many roll ins! Awesome! I am really enjoying watching that ss highlight disappear!If you want to repress the super shock product, I’ve repressed some with Mac fix + and it feels good as new. Congrats on all the progress!I feel like my Physician's Formula foundation never settles!Oof I hate it when lipsticks randomly break *side-eye Lisa Eldridge lipsticks* but such is life I guessI would maybe only roll up the lipstick enough to use it & only roll it all the way up to show progress? 💄 I also don’t own any SS’s & these videos from people doing the project make me never want to! 😂That thing with lipstick had happened with me too. In case of L'Oréal I wouldn't even bothered to revive it. L'Oréal lipsticks are not that precious.I swear, Colourpop super shocks are never ending products.... so easy to hit pan, but so hard to finish. My "Lunch Money" from HPPP had a casualty this month too, thankfully I managed to salvage it 😅😅...When your contaminated lipstick is gender confused. I didn’t know if it was a girl or a boy. HahaI love how your grey hair looks like tinsel.That ZOOM!Normally I would suggest wiping the lipstick off and pouring 91% alcohol on it to sterilize, but alcohol is hard to get right now. I've been rationing my bottle. Normally I like to use it on my lipsticks after a week of use just to keep them as germ free as possible. LolYeah ain't nobody got time for a lipstick that's contaminated at that point I am done with a product falls on the floor/smashes its the worst but in your case good as you get to roll in something new!You are far sweeter than cream gorgeous Christiana🤩❤️✨💐😘xx!brilliant video!😌✨Awwww Wallace hairContaminated! I totally get it. My Becca Moonstone fell out TWICE. The second time, I just said F it, it’s not for me. 😂Omg I’m so early 😳 nice update. Sorry about the lipstick lolalways love your project pan updates! 😊Your eye makeup is beautiful. Hahahahha i hope you like candles cos where youre going theres a lot of flames haha. You have used SO much of that highlighter. Your cream franken eyeshadow is just so beautiful. I say it every update but wow. The balm palette has such juicy progress.Girl, what is on tote nails? Stunning! I love your videos sooo much girl! Thanks for the videos! That eye look is beautiful! 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️❤️Also, how am I just noticing the half dressed dudes in the apple palette! LOLI feel the same way about lipstick. And I NEVER learn my lesson. I am always surprised every lip product that I pan. LOL!I bought 4 amuse Bouche lipsticks last year when they are on clearance because of the reformulation and have no idea what to do with them. Since they are natural I expect them to go bad soon, but because they are creamy I can't wear them under a mask (those Uber dry liquid lipsticks work well though!). But it seems like a waste just wearing them around the house? Not sure if I should just put them aside till this whole situation blows over (maybe next year??) Or just start using them now...So impressed with your progress!!You’re progress on the cream blushes always amazes me!  Your highlighter stick will be gone by next update for sure. That’s how I wear mine—all over the face before foundation. They go so fast that way. Great update!!omg look at that blush palette!!! AND THAT HIGHLIGHT STICK!

ALSO - is that Tati beauty glitters on your nails??? I love how it looks!

I swear you are the cream blush panning QUEEN - you are plowing through those products!You're doing well! Some of those products are SO CLOSE to being done!Aww no!! You will finish that lip product off, you could always use it as a blush and a lipstick (monochromatic day type of ordeal!)Well hellooooo mr crisp!! 😉

You can buy it again at Walmart.com! Yes!! We will all stare at it lovingly!!Great progress on stick highlighter✨ And yes that bite lipstick color looks very good on you!Maybe you can put the rest of the highlighter in a compact and use a beauty sponge to apply it. That way you wont be using your fingers.

You have some great progress!!Girl you are killing it!!! Also I wanna know if that lady was telling someone to go to hell or if it was a euphemism for something else lmaooLol 😂 🕯 🕯 🕯 🔥 🔥 🔥Hello guys, how are your project pans going?
Also if you want to check out how I created this look you can click here for a tutorial:  https://youtu.be/rpuoMgZoQFk 😘Ooooh yes!!! That looks like it would be a beautiful top coat for your nails!

Yay for a rollin!How did I miss this one 🤦🏽‍♀️... well I’m here now 😃💕Project planning :) You look absolutely stunning (as always).The eyeshadow is so eye catching. SHAME HAHAHAHAhahahah. You are so funny. 3 times is still 3 times more than last time. You go girl. You did so well with 2 roll ins. I've not tried either of your new roll ins before. Best of luck.If I dont like a physical scrub I use them on my feet🙈 at least they stay super soft !I love project panning AND PLANNING 😆😆😆 and hello to you too beautiful eyeshadow wearer!  😂 we probably all have those shameful profucts that we've had way over the supposed shelf life 👀Enjoyed your update as always Kailee!Project planning! I might be better at that than I am panning! :)Yay for two empties!!Congrats on 2 empties, Gorgeous! You are a panning inspiration to me! Love you so much! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaOkay, that's crazy that the foundation didn't move at all. I know three times isn't a lot, but I still expected some type of movement.Well hello you beautiful eyeshadow lover. 💕Love those hoop earrings! I love the look you did with that Juvia's palette. It's great that you're doing a project pan cuz you get to use the makeup in your collection that might've been neglected.

You got the stopper out.Great job Ashley, youre so close with the becca highlighter! So satisfying when you take out a stopper from a product, its a milestone within itself hahaYou are making steady progress, Beautiful so that's a good thing. Don't be so hard on yourself. You are a Mom to 3 Babies all while in a Pandemic. You are doing great all things considered! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaDoing well! You'll get there. :) Write yourself a little reminder note. ^_^You got this!! 💪💪🎉🎉🎉🎉Your partners in cream project pan is your best ever Ashley😍😍😍!I loved the intro Fey :) You are hair goals.  42g is unreal :O :OI used to have that hair oil, but it was too thick for my thin hair. I wish I would have thought about using it as a mask. Also, I love all the different moisturizers! :) LOL Great update!You seem so much more comfortable on camera in this video! 

What is in your lips? It looks beautifulHahahaha multiple moisturizers 😂Hahahaha I can completely understand being all over the place when you don’t have breakfast and coffee 😂Your camera made it through. You are making great progress. I need to use my stila glitters."I'm the color of paper." LOL! Enjoyed your update Tori!Stila glitters dry out so quickly. It's sad because they're so beautiful. You work on so many lip products throughout everything I'm amazed of your two uses on the lipstick! 🎉 It's still progress. Also, I'm loving your Halloween vibes shirt.Woohoo your camera didn’t die while filming 😅 great job so far 😊Glad to have you back!! And with an empty! Well done!I am happy to see you back 🤗ive exams in august 😫 you are doing so well. You are making progress on really hard products. Well done on your empty 👏Have you tried mixing the pomade up? Refreshing it that way? Sometimes it works. :)Woohoo!!!Well done with the empty foundation!! Great update overall Dannie!congrats on the new subs!  you deserve it girl!  keep it up!  you are doing an amazing job!  i can't wait to see when you finish that iconic highlighter!  it will be one of those SOOOO satisfying moments.Very Interesting 💕🌞🌹LIKEI’ve been wanting to try that Flower foundation forever.  I will have to wait till I’m done my other 6 I own. Lol. XoEvery time I watch any of your videos, I am just shocked at how much progress you make on everything with you panning so many products!
And I always love your lashes, they look amazing EVERY time I see you in a video!Congratulations on your growth! I am so happy for you ❤️Great job using up your make up!  The list says you need permission but they can follow the hashtag.I'm so happy your channel is growing! 💕 Declutters are always a crowd pleaser. 

Foundations are terribly hard to mark correctly. I feel like they never settle. Awesome for finishing that off and you're making such good progress on everything! 🎉 A primer is so smart to bring in because you'll use it everytime you do your makeup and it's kinda of a double go since it's not cruelty free. 🙌Doing well! :) I have UD Space Dust eyeliner as well. it takes FOREVER to make progress on. I've been using as a base for my inner corner highlight. It looks beautiful like that. :) Super sparkly.That's awesome that your declutter video did so well, Sweetie! I am so happy for your growth. Congrats on finishing the foundation! You are killing this project! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWell i am loving your hair. You are making such great progress. I loved hearing your plan on the bronzers.The never ending mini Bare Minerals sample...  I’ve had many mini products like that!  It’s a good thing that you like the color!  Lol!I think lip glosses go somewhat quickly, but actual lip color?  Slower than molasses!Steady as always! I hope all is well Paula!Your doing great!It’s so satisfying seeing people pan cream products in an actual pan 😃. You’re doing great Paula! 💗👍🏼great work!#neverhaveiever finished a liquid lip either... perhaps it's a contender for the project?I think you can finish the concealer pan you are working on & the lippie. You are so pretty, Paula, & your make-up always looks so natural. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYou look so prettyWhenever you decide to make a chatting video, would you consider also painting your nails and. Sharing your thoughts🥰 (i feel
Like it is not a properly constructed english sentence) 😂😂😂Love your hair🥰I think you can finish the mini by next update, as well as the elf pan you are focusing on!You are the most stubborn panner I know. Good for you! And I hear you on the bun struggles!I have never panned a liquid lip either so I’m with you. Mine will dry up before I even finish any. I’m accepted my fate 🤣I think you can tell the pan on Lunch Money has changed. You're doing so well with everything. 🎉You're doing well! You can definitely get that mini done by the next update. :) And that SS Highlighter is looking awesome!I think cosmetic brands must not watch panners. They would think: ah our products are too good value for money, we will have to start making them smaller 🤨.Don't you worry about the lighting. :) I understand completly in not wearing any makeup. Congrats on your move. I would LOVE to try that milk bronzer. You are the first person i've seen to use that up so much. Excellent update.The progress on that highlight! WOW!! Well done overall!I use natural lighting, and I have to sit directly in front of the window to make it work. Luckily the sun doesn't shine directly in, so it works. It can be a pain to figure out, but you will! And congrats on the move!Congratulations on the new home!🎉🙂I think we can forgive you for not wearing makeup while you're moving house. Congrats on the move! :) Woohoo!! Some of those products are super close to being done!Your eye makeup is just beautiful. You are making great progress. That blush looks so soo pretty.I use the YSL foundation stick in the shade B65 bronzer as a cream bronzer. It’s a beautiful bronzer shade and stays on all day. Amanda Devon here on YouTube uses it in almost all her videos.I absoluty love how you look today!You had a little guest appearance as well today LOLI love your eyeshadow xxI don't know why, but I love seeing you buy foundation after foundation. Maybe I'm living vicariously through you. 😁 Very nice update!Hey Steph, you're still moving in slow motion.....also I think we need to be introduced to your pupper!Girl I’m trying to peep that pup lol looks like a cutie. You are making great progress!Your dog is so cute and you are so close to rolling new things out. I bet you are happy to be done with a primer!Awww love your dog in the reflection  ❤️

You're doing well on all your products! :) You'll definitely have an empty or two next month. :)I think you are doing great! You finished a foundation, almost finished another one, expanded the pans in 2 items. Good job! I still use my old products. Lol! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaUPDATE!

I don’t blame you for taking a break on an item that you’re tired of using. I’m sure you’ll enjoy the change. Great update!!!I have never seen anyone finish one of those too faced liquid lips wow! Almost thereWow finishing a too faced melted lipstick would be amazing, I totally get getting sick of cool tones. I was a bit tired of cool tones and mauves so I swung back to warm browns and love itI really enjoyed your update! And you finished the catrice foundation already! That's always my luck to finish an item after filming an update video! :)That little blush quad is so pretty band versatile. Yes! Your eyelook is gorgeous. The pink and silver goes so well together.

Looks like you’re making solid progress! Great work💕You are diong so great !Those products are ridiculously close, but such in 2020 😅😅😉! Great update as always!That foundation 🤣😂 so funny.I am working on that ABH stick too! Mine is in golden. I don’t really love the coverage on it though...That foundation looks so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣I've always loved how healthy your hair isDo you wear lip colors at work even though you have to wear a mask or nah?Do you think on starting to use some new cream products once you finish the highlight and the primer or you'll wait for the next update?I think the foundation looks great on you and I love that lip color on you! 😍👍🏼An empty is great! Also, now I want to try that glossy primer. Like I need another primer. :)You're doing so well across your projects 👏 you'll do it with pat McGrath loss no problem 🤗🎉🥳👍💝
Super excited for this!Great job finishing the primer!! Yay!I threw away a few lip products lately that went bad.I'm going to need to get to my glossy skin primer. It's been open and unused while I work on others 😂. Well done on the progress!Congrats on the empty, Gorgeous! I think you will be able to finish the gloss. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThese nyx glosses and lip cream have so much product in them I just removed the stopper from my soft matte lip cream and it's literally full!I’ve been having a hard time with gloss cause of the mask thing. I had a momentum going and then it got covered 😷you could use a toothpaste squeezer on your tube productsI’ve been using my nyx gloss as my balm it works well! Lol great update!Congrats on finishing that primer!!!I hit pan on the Tonymoly cheektone cream blush! So happyI think the butter gloss from nyx is heavier than the PMG one, the nyx and the fenty glosses are the same weight but there seem to be less gloss in the nyx one, but the fact is that it's just a thicker formula so you need less to have the same weight!With my glosses, I  standing them in hot water, remove the stopper, lift the more liquidy product from bottom and pop the stopper back in. It really saves the wand from gooping up. Most stoppers can be replaced if you are careful with the removal. I have a habit of getting wand goop on my chin so I had to find a solution 😂You could try to open the primer and shake it upside down, so the product slides down and you can then press the air outYouve done great!congrats, good finish!!I totally understand panning too many products. Its important to have fun. Thank you so very much for doing this with us♥️ looking forward to your next project🤗Completely understandable! I feel like if you are happy with your choice to step away. You should! 💝 using everything in your collection with a lot of projects is so hard!this eye look on you is GORGEOUS! I also absolutely love your top!Your eye look is amazing, I love the flexibility in this project pan. Looking forward to your next project pan.I love your eyeshadow look in this video! It's so beautiful ❤You Look Stunning in this eye look😍🦋I completely relate with trying to project pan and yet still enjoying the rest of the collection! I really appreciate you joining us! Thanks from the bottom of my heart! I look forward to your next project!First view 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 and First comment🤗🤗🤗.How do you combine your colourpop cream highlight with powder blush?i love those flower beauty blush bombs.. can’t imagine using it up tho because cream blush u use so little productYou did so great as always ♥️👏you finished the two wetnwild highlighters, that's amazing!!!!You seriously are such a boss with all the panning! You are very motivating for sure! ❤️Why do you count the uses? To me, it would take the fun out of using my makeup products.I've noticed you really enjoy liquid lipsticks - do you find you go through them faster than bullet lipsticks? Your past updates show that you slowly use up Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks, do you think you'll begin investing more in bullet lipsticks instead of liquid lipsticks?I love your videos!!!Those progress pictures are soooo satisfying!Love the bright pink lip! 😍i'm never aware of how much glasses hide the eye makeup i'm wearing, but now looking at you i realize it does big time!You made some great progress! It's so exciting to see a liquid highlighter completely finished!The light is a wonderful idea to tally. So cleverGirl, no worries about the noise! My fan is on full speed so I can hardly hear you, let alone the tree people.Yay for 2 roll ins!! 👏🏼👏🏼I love, love your pan projects. Keep it up!Love your videos ❤️Omg so much progressGreat progress! For your sanity I hope whatever that construction/ destruction is stops soon!Focusing on cream products made me have pan in my tonymoly and canmake cream blushes almost used up a Mac lipstick, used half of a lime crime lipstick, made a lot of progress with 2 concealers!I am curious about how you track each product, did you use notes to help?You look very lovely! You did so great! 🎉🎉I swear I've been checking for a new upload from you since yesterday evening. :D I love your updates, they motivate me.

(psst, the links in the description box are broken. :-(( )Great video, great progress and you look fabulous with the bright pink lipstick.Congrats on getting to roll in 2 new products, Gorgeous! Loving that pink lip on you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ Nona*"I am so pumped..."* I double check to see if you're holding up a product with a pump ha, ha, ha lol! 😍❤️ You are without a doubt one of the most consistent when it comes to project panning!And 2 roll ins is awesome! Great job Dannie!Holy cow! That is a lot of use in that lip liner! Love hearing all your numbers btw!Your eye look is actually mesmerising. 😍 the purple lip glass looks stunning.You look so lovely in blue!! 💙💙💙omg Dannie, I am absolute entranced by your eye look - that shimmery white is absolutely stunning.
I am absolutely in LOVEI am so happy I came across your channel. You are so sweet. 💕. You look gorgeous. I love the eye look you have created, matches really nice with your shirt. So pretty. Would love to be friends on here. New subscriber here as I love your channel and love coming across YouTubers that are in the same niche making makeup videos like me. 😘Omg your eye look! I love it! 😍 You are so beautiful ❤️I love your eye look! So beautiful❤️ and you are the queen on panning! You’re doing so well!just when i thought that teal look couldnt get better!  i ALSO need to go through my lip product collection so i totally get it.  I also prefer pot liner but for whatever reason ive been trying out liquid pen liners so ill await your final thoughts when you finish that it cosmetics one.  the stila sample size i tried was great, the pretty vulgar one not so much.  i worry that they will dry out too quickly therefore not worth the money.Great update, Dannie!!  Keep on truckin👍🏼Dang girl, your eyeshadow is popping!! Great job on rolling the products out!! 😊Ooo I love this eye look. Makes me think of Frozen.You look like a fairy ice Queen, & I mean that in the best possible way. You look stunning in blue, Dannie! Congrats on 2 empties. I have never had luck with cutting products open either. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThat's a bummer about the primer. I don't blame you for not wanting to mess with cutting things open after that. Do you mix your liquid highlighters in with primer/foundation? Just curious. You're making such good progress! 🎉 I'm always so amazed with how many uses you get out of everything. I know that's a lot of work, but it's fun to hear your usage tracking.I can't wait to see that lip color on you! 💜I love your eye shadow!✋👍Oh thay shirt is so damn cool! I want that also😅 Hmmm, maybe 194 or 204 uses with the bronzer😝Super that you don't give up with it!You look beautiful with hoops! ❤️170 is absolutely amazing. You are honestly doing so well👏I don't think the shimmer and glow is bad, but I think it may be drying out - if you have eyedrops they can help make it more liquidy and work betterSteady progress as always! Love your shirt!I hear you can rehydrate the Stila liquid shadows so I wouldn't throw it out. I would definitely finish up the foundation. You are so close. Stay safe, Gorgeous! TFS! ~ NonaI add eye drops to my stila products! Seems to work for a while. Maybe you could try mixing the TF primer in with the foundation so it’s not so full coverage? Enjoyed the update! :)Love your eye look. 170 times wow. That bronzer is worth the price tagGreat progress! I’ve revived the Stila glitters with face oil but then they had lots of fall out sadly!I vote you take the Stila glitter out. Also I think that TK primer is pretty much done unless you cut it open pues. Awesome job my friend. Also love the purple eyes.Mariela,if you add 3 drops of Alovera gel in the stila,it will bring it right back.Don't throw it out..💗Your shirt is so cute!
You’re doing great, watching these motivates me to use my cream products more!3 projects is a lot! You are doing great though. I am really excited to see your progress with the bronzer 💕Love your shirt 🥰🦋🦋I find it so overwhelming if I'm doing too many projects at once. I'm currently doing two project pans and I do a seasonal shop my stash. I don't know how you keep up with everything and you still made great progress!Same choices gal🤩🤩🤩stila is my all time favorite✨❤My stila is on the thicker side too, I don’t think it’s bad, but I mixed in some setting spray to make it thinner🎉🥳💝Hey guys! So I just wanted to say thank you for being patient while I reply to all of your lovely comments. I think I am all caught up with replies, but if I missed your comment somehow I do apologize! It is never my intention to not respond to anyone. Thank you all for all of your support. 💕That frankenshadow is sooo big! I am soooo impressed with your progress so far! Not to mention that damn palette! Killing it!I hope you film the crunching of the blushes into the blush palette when that comes. Thats so exciting. I love the products you rolled in. I think i have set to stun but the cp highlighter looks beautiful ♥️honestly I'm SO EXCITED to see when you crunch up those colourpop blushes into the your new create your own blush palette, I'm STOKED!Ohh the dark shade in the inner half of the kids definitely vamps up the look. Woohoo on finishing more highlighters!Oh no! Yeah, with all your pets i'd call the Milk cream bronzer stick done. That SSS looks suuuuuper pretty!! Enjoy! :)One of my cream highlighter sticks recently broke and hit the floor too. I hate it when that happens. You always amaze me with how quickly you go through cream blush!What a great update!  You are killing the game girl!Great update!! Love the idea of continuing to use the blush palette  🎨Eww 🤣🤣 I have had that spray sunscreen in my mouth and nostrils so many times, no thank you 🤣That eye look looks very beautiful on you!! 💜Love the eye look Ale ! You are the best I’m binging on your videos since this is the first time in months I’ve been able to do itI am allll for that glitter. Yes girl!! Beautiful 😍 look at you go. Loving the products you chose to work on and why♥️ omg the stila 😲🤯omg congratulations finishing up that heavens hue bronzer shade!!I love the way you say 'family', it sounds a lot like our Italian version 'famiglia' :) And I'd stare at myself too if I had all that sparkle on my eyelids XD
I would never be able to have so little time for a panning project, at least for not skincare products: even sunscreen gives me a hard time to pan. I hope this year to be able to pan at least one product (or a body sunscreen, a face sunscreen or a sunscreen stick for sensitive zones) but I will wear them longer than 3 months. I started to wear them around May, and we have sunny days and exposed arms and legs until the end of September sometimes.I'm so impressed to see you working on panning these cream products. Those are the most difficult ones to use up for sure!  I find that skincare items are difficult, & lip glosses are particularly one of my biggest nemesis to use up too, as I also forget to reapply. With the mask-wearing, I have to go matte (or use a lip balm), & then save the gloss for when I'm a homebody (which is actually most of the time). 😂💄👄What brush do you use with the kitten highlighter to use all over the face ?thank you sooooooooooooooooooooooomuch uuuuuummmmmmhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa i want kiss you on chiksI love your eye makeup 😍😍😍Nail color is 💝😍😍😍😍OMG. 💓 This lip gloss 💓Beautiful beautiful beautiful eyes!Wow!!!

Nice job rolling another product out!I love your eye look!!! 😍😍😍Yours eyeshadows are so so prettyLook at you and your regress on that Stila product good job!!Your earring are the bomb!You finished an entire highlighter?????? DamnnnnnnThis eye look is amazing!!❤️Great job! Love your eye makeup :)Love your eye look!  The swatch of Kitten is really pretty!  I have heard many people mention it but I have never tried it. One day, when I get through all of my highlighter products…. And by then it will be discontinued! LOL!That gloss is so fabulous and it look really good over you💚Omg your eyes 😻😍😍😻your eye makeup is everything!Your eye makeup is on point!! Absolutely loving it 🤩Things starting to calm down for you some yet? I know everybody's already said it but you look stunning! Also how the HECK can you pan a nail polish? I'm so impressed and jealous that you're having trouble getting it out and the end is in sight.Your eyes are amazing 😍😍😍Wowowowow! That empty Stila highlight! Wow!Beautiful! 😍I love that bronzer and your eyeshadow, very prettyWhat are you wearing? It’s so pretty , the description box was empty 😄I’m living for yo eyeshadow in this video 😍 yes 👏mama👏work ❤️Loved This Vedio Soooooo muchh 😍😍😍😍👍👍I need to do a pan with my creme collectionLaundry detergent hahaha. I cant wait to see some looks with the shadow stick and stila ♥️i always wonder if washing my brushes/sponges with face wash would be effective


"dry products" killed me lol!!I had that Neutrogena cleanser and didn't like it on my face either. How did I finish it? Used it as bathroom hand soap.Hi Kailee, I love your beautiful makeup. Great update on your project pan. Lol about not using your Estee Lauder foundation. I like the elephants in the background, is that new? I've never tried the Neutrogena face wash. Lol! I like the scent of laundry detergent tho lol. Hahaha the bloopers at the end!I love your background..beautiful painting!! That stila glitter looks STUNNING!!How cute are you with your little blooper reel? Very cute. 😘I had the mini of the Golden Eye and it was terrible. It swatched so pretty but on the eyes it sheared out so much. Hopefully that is not your experience with it. 

Omg. Please try the Neutrogena as a laundry detergent and report back. 😂Omg. The elephant painting! 😍It's been a long week and it's only Monday 😆😆 I can relate.I love the elephant painting in your background. It is beautiful! I love your look too...gorgeous! I wouldn't want something I put on my face to smell like laundry detergent either. Lol! Your bloopers @ the end were so cute. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThat eyeshadow stick is gorgeous 😍Your painting is back!!  I adore that paintingAwe I love the elephants 🐘😍I love the outtakes at the end. I have days like that too. You have a great laugh!Yay Kailee awesome update 👍👍laundry detergent really😂😂No judging on nails, mine almost never look nice. Maybe for the first 5 mins after I do them 😬Awe super prettyLove the bloopers 😁 😁 😁!That eyeshadow stick should be great for fall!Woohoo!! 
#notificationsquadStunning Elephant artwork in the background love🤩🤩🤩🐘🐘🐘!Your eye makeup is really breathtaking 😍😍Awwww Stephhhhh i honestly love you. You said such nice things that 1 i wanted to cry and 2 i  had to replay it for Padraig because he needs to step it up a notch hahaahah. We do vibe.I was laughing like the whole way through, love the fake tan disclaimer all the time haha and reward myself with 5 products hahahah. Your eye look is stunning and your tan is juicy. I can imagine you being so energetic as a kid and like bouncing off the wall. Haha. I used to make the worst decisions thinking i was actually talented and clearly wasnt. Jumped out of the tree house to land on the trampoline, thought it was a good decision and upon landing i destroyed my bank and landed in another tree fell off the tree and landed on the ground. I relate😂😂😂 you are making great progress.Hey everytime I see your vidos,I  just see your eyes and admired your voices😍😍😍😍😍😍I Know you aren't feeling your look today, but I am absolutely obsessing over it!!!Your eye makeup it's so beautiful loking osm giv me tutorial🤗💛💛Hearing about your antics as a child had me smiling with recognition....I used to do cartwheels, handstands, jumping everywhere as a kid. I jumped up and down on my parents bed, it was my trampoline.....and was doing stomach landings one happy day on it, and my chin caught the end of their bed and I cut my chin. Blood everywhere. Me crying.  Rushed off to the doctor for stitches in my chin. A few days later, I'm bouncing up and down on my parents bed again, using it as a trampoline 🤣🤣
My poor parents!😂

I bruise really easily as well, and frequently I'm sporting a bruise, almost always on my arms or legs.

Your progress in this project is good 😊I was thinking how much I liked your eye look right as you said you didn’t like how it turned outI really like the eyelook🔥I really liked how your eye look turned out - I may have to try something similar 🤔. I personally have tried the Kiko Milano Velvet Touch Creamy Stick Blush and have been loving it. It can be quite pigmented so I used a very small amount and then tap it out with a sponge, but it gives a gorgeous hue to my cheeks.steph was staningExcited 💝I have been loving the EM Cosmetics blush drops. I heard a lot of mixed reviews but I haven’t had any issues and they are stunning. I picked up three shades and really had to talk myself out of buying them all. 😄 

And I swear every time I think “Dang I like her eyeshadow look a lot today” you say you don’t like it 😂I wanted to check out everyone's videos off the spreadsheet link and it says access needed :/That eyelook is amazing!!!!I think you're being to critical. You look great! I love the eye look and I don't think it clashes (at least on camera). I need to make more progress on my creams... lol Overall I just need to wear more makeup to get through my project items. You're doing pretty well. Remember any progress is still progress!Hourglass Sheer illume trio!We have the same makeup vanity! 🤩 Where did you get yours from? Love your videos as usual x they always inspire me to continue my pan rotationEverything is cool especially That Primer....🤩💖🤩Love the eye look!!! 😍💖💖💖Your eye look is stunning.Mmhmmm cream blush! I’m wanting the exact same Fenty shade as the one you have.I'm always shocked at how much good progress you have on foundations! Great update Steph!Your eye makeup is so prettyyy😍❤I love your eyeshadow! Also, your kind words about me... 😊 Thank you so much! It honestly means so much!!!!I relate so much to being scared of using your new products! I always buy new makeup and when I'm about to use it, I just feel guilty and that I shouldn't be using it😂 I love the eyelook tho😍Gorgeous! Can you do a video on everyday makeup essentials ❤️❤️Lol you are so Funny! Love Glossier 😄 Thanks for the vid!So gorgeous makeups! <3 loved it ♡ :]😍I’ve heard people use the olehenriksen primer as a moisturizer and put another primer overtop.

I saw that cover fx shimmer veil at marshals not that long ago I should have got it cause ur eyes look amazing.I am so sorry to hear that you lost a friend. Take care of yourself!I will echo Steph! 13 times is pretty dang good these days!13 days is amazing. Its been a total struggle to wear makeup. I love the products you have.

You look amazing. 😍I have one bottle of the foundation that settles and the other doesn't. 😂 I use the lightest two colors because I'm neutral.i know the florida heat/humidity sucks but damn your skin looks so healthy and glowy😍You are an  inspiration for my projects, I love your videos !!!!The blush refuses to die. Almost like the Walking Dead Series. LOL.Soon you're just going to start throwing the Kaja cushion at your cheeks and Michael will laugh even moreDang Christina. You are looking glowy. I love the look you have on today.I do like to hang out. ☺️Wow you look so dewy today ✨😍The physicians formula foundation does settle but only if you lay it flat on its side💕You are the goddess of glowing Christina🤩💛🔥, you are on a roll with this partners in cream series💐😘xx!2 empties is great! Not like I am surprised though. :)When are you going to update your makeup inventory? 🥰Fantastic!!You made fantastic progress👏 i am excited for the cream abh palette.That foundation will be done soon for sure! Love seeing your updatesAlright Rebeca, I’m almost finished watching ALL of your videos and now the panners that I’ve been watching seem boring compared to you. Do you (or anyone else here in the comments) have any channel suggestions for panners that actually have progress like you do?  You get it done and that’s what I want to watch going forward.  Is there anyone on YouTube even remotely close to being as good at panning as you?You always do so well with your products! I'm over here struggling. 😂 Well done!I really like the FAB lip balm, too! I started using it when I had dermatitis around my mouth, and it helped with that, as well as dry lips. I bought two more when they were $10 on the FAB web site and they were offering free shipping. I think it's been discontinued, though! Ulta still has it, but on the FAB site, it is marked "final sale" which isn't a good sign.How long did you have the contour palette before you started using it?Congratulations on your met goals!!wow you’ve made a dent in that abh foundation stick... im also using one up in the fall4u projectI loved that ABH cream contour....I love your videos💚 Will you do a makeup collection tour video?Steady progress!

Its so hard 😂🥳🎉Wow that lip color is 🤩😍 and great update! goodluck with this projectGirllll you look so stunning in this video!😍😍😍 love this look on youI feel you on forgetting products!

Hey but progress is progress. :) Good job!Hello 👋🏽❤️Great video love your eyeshadowWoohoo!! 🎉🎉 ❤️Great work on that spf!! Girl I perform surgery on any squeezy tubes that I can open on the table!! 😁😁

Also yay for a lip empty! Am I right in thinking that is the 2nd lip empty for you in this project?Progress is progress, especially considering covid life! Good job!Covid is affecting everyone's usage this year I think. My pan that palette is basically a write off 😂 xxxxAnd 2 other goals met! Wow. I suck at using lip products, so i am blown away at you finishing anything in a liquid lipstick format!Dang! That highlight progress is serious! Love it!So close on that HL!!If you hate an item, def. call it done! No need to torture yourself.I am always reminded that I eventually need to roll in my SS in frog into this project. Whoops!Your new glasses are amazing..like you and your eyes..

I forgot to mention in the video. We are doing this project again next year. We will finish this year December 10th and start new year new project on January 10th. Next year we will have a refresh option every quarter because this year was a train crash haha. I hope all is well :) PS. I just saw part of my video did a 2020 and broke for a few seconds hahaHi Steph! 💕💕 perfect time of year to rock that ND red blush!🥳🎉💝💝Apparently ballet slippers is the queen's favourite nail varnish 😆You are (as always!) doing an awesome job!
I actually really love that you are working on a new item.  I feel like many of us panners are guilty of not using new stuff because we are working on older products.  Enjoy!Hooray for new pan!!!Love your realistic goals. Happy to see you make progress!You did so well this past month, as always 😊 I'm excited to see  work on that Natasha Denona palette as I am debating to buy it or the Bloom single blush! xwow you are good at panning product 😊👏💛 I have bought an apartment, so now packing of makeup starts 💛 will pick out products for two months that I will use until I move 😊👏💛 have a makeup suitcase that I will use to put makeup in  .👏 Space for a lot in it 👏 From Ida in Norway 🥰 Stay safe 💛I was surprised you picked the deeper red cream blush! But I’m looking forward to your next update! 🤩I only know one person who has hit pan on that blush from ND palette. Love the new polish shades you rolled in.I’m glad you kept the cream highlighter in!   You made great progress!WOO HOO! Massive pan in the cream highlighter! We love that! You are doing so well. I am glad that y'all are bringing this project back next yr. I really enjoy watching everyone's updates. I think the refresh option was a great addition. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWell done. I'm so happy I switched my Bronzer and highlight. No reason to pan something that looks terrible on you. Curious about the ND!You sound relieved to not deal with any more products in this project.Wait a second... I must have missed your last update because I recognized the Sleek eaulala liner in a blink of an eye, but I don't remember you panning it. I actually have the exact same, with an orange one, but they are classified as lip liner in my stash. Cause I remember that you can you them on your eyes and lips.Another great update!  I love the juicy panual. 😁. I’m so excited you’re doing this project again next year. I love this project!!!woohoo! yay for hitting pan!!I felt a disturbance in the force...like someone was calling my name 😁. I'm a huge fan of y'all's community, and I pan a wide variety of things: cologne, toothpaste, cartons of milk 😅Dang! Look at all this pan!Bo loved being included! 😁I think it's a great idea to pan the ND blush (although good luck because I've heard they have a ton of product). Work on something new that you love. You deserve to enjoy your new stuff instead working on older things you want gone.I’m doing nail polish rotations as well! Trying to use some up and make room for more Pacifica nail polishes that I’ve been loving here lately. Also, nail polish collection??I’m going to join in with you on the Natasha Denona Bloom palette. I just Twitterpated and was looking into another cream blush i can pan. The Natasha Denona Bloom palette sounds like a wonderful project to work on with you 😊😊😊🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼I waited patiently for the PANNUAL and I wasn't let down 😂❤️Great job on all your progress! I love this look btw! Cool tones look so beautiful on you!!How exciting to finish that blush!!!Great progress! Way to get your money's worth!Awesome progress on the highlighter and blush.Great job on that cream blush woohoo!! Those take longer than most thinkCongrats on finishing the cream blush! Great progress as always!!Yay! Well done this month. It's so nice when you finally get some of those long term products out, and you are so close on that highlighter too! Also, is that Ripple I am spying on your lids? 😊I just bought two of those flower beauty blush bombs 💀 good to know they will last forever! If you do use that essence lip product as a cream blush, not only will you use it up faster if you wear it as a lip at the same time but you will also have your makeup look more put together because it will be the same tone!Congrats on finishing the cream blush, Tash! That took a long time. Lunch Money is almost done too. You are so good @ panning! Stay safe! TFS! ~ Nonasuch an impressive update! I;m glad to hear the Pur spray is almost gone lol.Oh heck yes! Congrats on finishing that blush! Wow! Great update!I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow look. The cream blush is a particular accomplishment. You've made so much progress. Lunch money is practically gone 👏Loving your makeup! It’s so ethereal. Finishing that blush is amazing! I really want to use up a blush some day lolIt's so satysfying and encouraging to see your progress! You're one of my Top Panners 😁👏Cream blushes in tubes are so hard to get through!  I have one maybe half the size of your flower one and I am going on a year of using it every time I wear makeup (it's my only blush) and I am just over half way done-crazy!They dont sell flower beauty at my walmart anymoreYou’re doing so well!  My project pan for 2020 derailed when I started spending so much time at home in March, and I have not restarted it.  I should get going again.  :-)*Looks at how much Tash has used of her Lunch Money highlighter...* turns to look at my Lunch Money highlighter that I've used 5 times since purchasing it (before Covid-19)... turns again to look at my Berlin Girl Glow highlighter... turns again to look at my Amrezy highlighter... turns again to look at Fuego... turns again to look at Whisper of Gilt, Daybreak Glimmer, Damage Control, Star Island etc etc etc. Oh yeah I was talking about Lunch Money lmao! 😅😂🤣Curious if you have any different feelings finishing product based on type?  For example, I feel more accomplished finishing a pressed powder product instead of liquid or cream.Yay way to go on that cream blush! You are making great progress on everythingSuch a good update, next update you’ll be full of empties. 😊your eye looks always inspire me to wear some color!🥳🥳🥳190! Good grief! Worth that money!!! Nice job overall!I used up one of those Chanel bronzers years ago when I only owned one bronzer. Now my collection is out of control 😬The Chanel bronzer definitely seems worth it! You’re doing well! I need to join in on this project next yearUhm this video just started and I was emotionally provoked to tell you that YOUR WHOLE LOOK AND VIBE...... ma’am! What?! YES! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 also, I feel like your makeup gave me Halloween vibes with like the dark hair and the reds and oranges!Holy crap that’s a lot of uses. If only they didn’t change the formula. Love the makeupMariela, you are so gorgeous! I love that lippie on you! That Chanel bronzer is definitely worth the price. Keep up the good work! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaMakes the Chanel bronzer so worth it! Even with the high price tag, just knowing how far it can go is awesome. Good job!that chanel bronzer wow! seems like you get your money's worth, great job!190 times for Chanel dang friend you are doing the damn thing. Also your makeup look is giving me like spring on top fallish on the bottom and I'm loving it.Please start using ur SPF in the morning 😱 it's really important if you're getting sun in any way/shape or formGood lord Mariela 190 times. I am so committed to the chanel product that i will follow it til the end hahaOoooooo switswoo booowm chicka wooowm wowwm. Look at your hair too yess🤩 i feel a red silk gown on you too and perhaps a red carpet is required for this fantastic look ♥️Love this lookI really like your makeup look , looks so good 😍So fun to switch those palette pans around! Awesome idea!You are so creative with your palettes! I am now so inspired to mix and move products in my collection 😊 Love to be able to use different products for things they are not meant for, especially when I pan. And, this is my favourite project too 👍Your switch-a-roo totally makes sense.  I wish that all palettes had plastic dividers when mixing powder and cream products.Of course we are good friends. I feel  privileged to have met you. We have a lovely relationship if i do say so myself. Im still in work watching this in the fire exit haha. Thank you so much. You are actually so committed. Omg you are using the freedom. Its so much fun to play and that's important too. Good lord over 20 times 😲 you are so good. That shades is lovely on your brow bone. Omg squirrel 😂😂😂 excellent. I love a good cream contour. I actually would love seeing you add those cream products in that one palette but the photo was super helpful. You used up sooooo much product. Well done.Hi! What eyeshadow's are you wearing? Your look is amazing!Looooovvveee your whole asthetic/makeup!  U look bomb!!I hate to say it but the Ilia blush is actually a full size.  I was really surprised to see how small it was especially for the price.I'm actually really into the Rare Beauty products and I want to buy a ton of stuff.What eyeshadows are you wearing?!😍👅I love your make up, your eyes look amazing ♥️♥️♥️Beautiful background. Your project pans are the best. Love you ♥️♥️♥️🥳🎉💝💙💙💙Excellent update!!You did amazing this month! And  close on that Wander Beauty eyeshadow!! You also look amazing, both your eyes and lips look great and work so well together 😊Beautiful makeup look steph!your skin looks amazing! 🧖🏼‍♀️😍I love these project updates 💗/pauses video 16 seconds in. Steph, your sweater is cozy goals. 😍 Would you be willing to share where you got it?So I have the ilia pigment in that same shade and it is awesome!  The product is pretty slow to move through progress wise, I have found that mixing it with a cream highlight adds a nice glow and also allows you to use more as the highlight sheers it out ❤️Great progress! I jut placed my rare beauty order can’t wait for it to get here. I have RA so I love her reasoning for the packaging. Mine doesn’t give me that much of a problem yet but glad someone is thinking of that.Oooh I need to pull out that Ilia liquid blush again. I just recently got it and have only used it once, but I think I will pull it into my shop my stash for the fall season!you are doing so well on this project!!And same... Die hard for primer!How do you like to apply your fenty blush? I just hauled the orange shade, and I haven't figured it out just yet.Look at your rolling out products!! why do husbands always take the fun out of makeup shopping😋I know you have said you don’t wear pink eyeshadow often but I gotta say I love it on you. You remind me of ballerina. So pretty!!! Ok back to watchingI’m so glad you tried my recommendation and were able to finish the banana bight primer!! You should definitely try the Rare Beauty line, especially the cream blush and the dewy lip balm 😊oooooooooooh loved it!!!! tysm for making another one of these!! 💖yay!!!!another project pan update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<3 can't wait to see the video!❤ your make-up look, it looks so glowy and fresh. Very beautiful! 🙂👍It's amazing.
Lots of love ❤❤.I really like this new background! It’s like your makeup story time coming to us from your cozy makeup corner 😊You are so pretty! I would like if you do a full face makeup look with your products from different project pans💞Steph your dog is hilarious. Imagine you if you were in school hahahaha. Thank you so much for the sweet words. ♥️😂 i am curious where you are at re your 100 empties goal? HahaI just picked the rare beauty blush in bliss! so excited!!Dang girl two products! You're killing it!!!you make me wanna start project panning as well! Love watching these🥳🎉💝Nice job with your items! Also, good luck at the new job! So exciting!Congrats on the job, I hope they keep you on after your trial! Good luck to you! I hate goopy polish. You're a trooper going along with these products. Weird that you couldn't get the stopper off. I usually use a knife edge on tough ones or I just end up stabbing the stopper and forcing it out lol. I'm a monster. I would say cut that spf with something to better shade match you, but that defeats the purpose of sunscreen. lol I know that feeling of having something almost done, but not quite. ;) Well done though!Look at you go. You are so consistent on hard products. You are getting there on your top coat.👏🥳🎉💝Thanks for the update and congrats on 10k!!!!🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗👍🏿You’re so close to 10,000. I hope someone sees this comment and subscribes.You did so well, that Stila highlighter is so satisfying to look at! 😄Awesome update Alex! Love your eyeshadow as always!you should mix those 2 nars blushes ! you could finish one and use the other at the same time :)Hi Alex, I was having problems with YouTube which was related to my laptop , I'm hoping it stays fixed. I'm glad to be back. Your Kat von d lipgloss and Nars blush amazing 🧡🧡You’re doing so well on those nars blushes! This was the perfect project for them 🙌🏼That eyeshadow look is stunning!!!Great progress, as always 👏 Love your eyeshadow look in this video, it looks so elegant 💕Well done this month (as always)! I have Luster in a powder form and I LOVE it for Autumn. I actually filmed a video about my top tips/makeup for transitioning into Autumn and I included it in there 😊Well done on your amaaaazing progress. The cream highlighter is sooo enjoyable to see. The liquid blush you rolled in looks so pretty.So excited to hear they’re doing it again next year! I’m thinking of joining when I’m done with my current project.Wow I'm impressed with the Stila highlighter and the Nars blush!i was like "NOOOO, finish that blush!!!" lol!You are doing so well!!! I have never used up a lipgloss in my life. I like more the traditional lipstick bullets 👍🥰Ale it gives me anxiety that you are not just finishing torrid 🤍 I would finish it! lol congrats on your updateswell done! i think you can finish that nars blush you have such good progress on it!I love the Nars blush for the fall!! It’s such a pretty shadeWhat a great update! And as always, that blush progress! 😍😍I always think twice before adding more cream products to my collection because they go bad sooner, but like you I rotate through my items so everything gets used. I also think as long as I got good use out of a product before it expires then I got my money’s worth. I love to pan items but I don’t feel like I need to 100% use up all my products. If that was the case then, I’d have to be wearing makeup in heaven,  whenever my time here is up, to try to pan everything. I actually wouldn’t mind that. 😂at least with the KVD lippie you can see your progress....so many lip products its not as easy to tell..I am hurrying to use my ABH foundation stick in golden as long as I have my tan. September is the last month I can. I almost bought that Nars liquid blush in luster, maybe I will some day, but I own Puerto Vallarta in their multiple sticks, I am afraid they would be dupes.Yay!!! I need some company while I work from home 😊Isn't the blush that separated is probably expired?🤔Could you possibly do a Swatch of the Nars blush next time?First😹💕You look beautiful! And cant wait for Round 2! I definitely feel like I need to refresh all my products!🥳🎉🎉I really like that Jack Black lip balm too!!!  I wasn't expecting to, but it is so good. Great update!First off, I love that orange lip!! 😍 Second Moonwalk is gorgeous! Now I feel like I need to track it down. 😅I can't believe that I didn't found your channel until now! 🤯
I'm doing the project on Instagram and I'm happy that it will be next year too 😊Yay! Will definitely be joining in next year❤️I loved pairing sea siren with lavenders and cool blues. I never tried it with any warm shades so I have no recommendations there lol👏👏👏for using up a lip product!!! Did not here the music from the neighbours by the way. Black really suits you and your eye look is so nice 😊 I joining the project next year, for sure - my favourite project ❤️That Super Shock Shadow is absolutely stunning!! You did amazing this month, despite lots of travelling and not having all your items with you 😊 Well done! xWell done on your amazing. I am sooo excited for the products you rolled in. The highlighter is going to be fun to see. I think once i hit pan on all my super shocks ill roll in either jelly much or stila glitters. Im not sure how long a full size stila would take 😂🤯Aww I loved that Stila glitter shade! It was perfect during summer you got this maybe just try using it with purple shadow? Yay for a finished lippie 💖Yay!!! 🎉🎉I’m so happy that this project will be back next year. Congratulations on creating such a fun and clever project. I predict a few empties for you next month 😉Love the new super shock you rolled in. Great job finishing up that lip product. You look beautiful!Just heard that this going to continue next year! Can’t wait! I’m joining in January! ❤️I'm sure I'll stick with this next year too. I might not do a full face project like this year so I can play with more makeup in my stash. So next year might be better progress. 😂 You look stunning. Well done on the progress. Also best to use something that you know you love!I would love to see a video on what makeup you brought back from home. I’m so nosey lolI’m glad you guys are doing this project again. It’s one of my favorites!  I really enjoy using the Jack Black lip balms as well. I love the formula.Nice progress. I would use the Stila all over the lid with a topper...toppers really can change a color but the actual color looks great on you. I'd also consider it for an eyeliner esp as an extra sassy line under your usual black winged liner. Have you tried it as a shadow base?I love this project, well done!Hi 😀! Great progress on your products 👏👏👏. We did check the possibilities for going to Florida because of our house, but it is totally impossible atm 😪. I just thank God every day for our neighbor who takes care of everything 🙏🙏🙏. He sent me a picture a month ago of the kitchen island filled with all of my packages 😂😂😂. Hopefully the vaccine will come soon, so the world can start to go back to some kind of normal 😊.  How are you doing?? Are you working now, or are you staying safe at home?I love this project, I'm so glad you both decided to do a round 2. Great job with your progress!Great progress! Love your lip color!🥳🥳I can def. see that pan in the kabrow! That pomade took me forever to go through! The full size lasted me over 2 years!!!I am loving your hair and makeup look in this video!That super shock is so pretty!! You are right, it is very winteryI'm so impressed with the progress on the Benetint.  Those last forever.  Will you be doing this project again next year?Your nails are stunning with the eyes.Nice, Thanks for the vid💖💖💖Girl your skin and hair look gorgeous 😍 🔥I'm working on my KaBrow! pomade too. I had hit pan and ended up putting the little product jar on my candle warmer to melt the product down off the sides. It worked well and didn't affect the product quality. More recently, I put the little jar in the microwave for about 10 seconds at a time, and that method also melted the product back down.such great progress! good job hitting pan on the super shock!You hair is particularly beautiful today. I am exited for revolution again. You always do so great. XWhat a gorgeous look!Great video! Your hair looks extra nice this time! The dark lip is very cool! I dont know if you said already but what is it?Such great progress. The super shock you have in is so pretty. Loving your hair!You can multipurpose the pomade as an eyeliner or a lower lash line liner to get more use out of iti used to have those benefit tints along time ago i kind of miss them haha! well done!the curls are so flattering!Well done😊 love your nails! 🧡I want to meet the bunny!!!! Nice update Tori!You are making great progress on tough products. I really need to pull out my cp highlighter 👏Progress is progress!You are making a good bit of progress. That foundation is really on its way❤You are making progress! 👍Wow. That colourpop blush stick is nice!! And heck yes to finishing that Kaja blush!!!! YAY!It isnt natural how excited i am for the blush empty. I always loved the stronger blush look on you. It really suits you. You'll have the cp highlighter done in no time👏Excellent video!!1 Christina, I've a query... How do you use up pore filling silicone primer? I wasn't that aware when I bought it. I'm unsure whether it's okay to use it on daily basis - skin damage etc. How to finish up??Love your eyes and your hair style.  Pretty bow!!!  Nice progress keep it up!!!   See you next time.💜I really love that pink on your eyes. It makes your eyes look super blue.🥳🎉💝Congrats on finishing that blush! Finishing a blush is always an accomplishment!Again, amazing progress 😊 Can't believe that the cream blush is finally done!a cream blush is always great as a lipbalm as well. of course, without overapplying to the point of a layer of goop sliding around the mouth. a normal proper applicated works perfectly with these cream blushesI love project pan  vedeosThat prismetal...!!! 😍😍😍 Looks like it would be beyoootiful as a base for other colors. Oooo so pretty.Your eye makeup is awesome😍💖😍I am obsessed with how you did your eye makeup here and will be attempting to recreate it asapI love that forest green background. I am so ready for falli feel you on the "too much" blush! i was also panning a cushion blush and applied soo many layers, but I also finished it!💜💙💚I always tell people wear what makes you happy! If too much blush to use up a product works for you, do it!! Sometimes I look like Cleopatra cuz I keep fixing my eyeliner to even it out. Eventually, I just say fuck it! It makes me happy to just leave it alone and let it be for the day!😉You finished the blush!!! Congrats 👏, you look beautiful with a lot of blush and you look beautiful now 💕So proud of you for finishing the blush finally! She finally died! Lol! 😂Yass bye blush! 👏There’s no such thing as too much blush!!That hair and bow. Who's she? She fierce! 
Yay!!!! The blush is done! I don't believe in too much blush, only too much bronzer, especially if it is orange. I end up being an oompa loompaPerhaps try rewetting the supershock highlighter a tiny bit by putting in a bit of hyaluronic acid serum/toner and that should make it easier to apply so you use it up faster. That what i did with my super shock shadows and now they feel brand new. Just be careful not to add too much or itll become sludge.If my husband keeps refusing to help me cut my hair, I’m going to have a 2007 Britney Spears moment, as well. 😳
I love your eyeshadow. ☺️Never to much blush!The bow in your hair is utterly adorable Christina🤩💛✨!This eye look is giving me lifeI so understand the frustration with colourpop super shock highlighters! I’ve gone through two and I love them but towards the end they’re dryer and not as fun to use.I think I'm definitely doing this project next year lol its such a great idea and I need to use up a lot of lip products lol2 new items! Nice job!!That foundation has great progress considering you have to mix it. It is very impressive!Always love your updates! Congrats. I really need to use my lip liners. I only have like 30 🙄🙄 (way to many!) and I need to get that down.You are doing FANTASTIC. I find concealers take me forever 👏Love this :)Wow amazing finishing up 2 glosses. I’m still working on my one all year 🤣🤣🤣Woohoo look at you two lippies out and I’m over here on the struggle bus lol great update!!Great job finishing two glosses!!🙌🥳🎉❤Well done getting two products out this month 😊 Can't wait to see how you do with your new roll-ins!My favorite shade from the nyx glosses is praline 😍 Tempted to pick up some other shades I love the formula so much and really prefer it to the fenty glossbombThe first person I’ve seen do project pan is Kelly Gooch. Then YouTube recommended you. And now I’ve found Alejandra Lissette. Between you  3 ladies, I’m so inspired to use up my products. 🎉 BTW ur eye look is Gorgeous! 😊❤️💄Great job with two new empties! 
I have a lot of projects going now, too, and can’t wait for some of them to finish. I’m enjoying them all, but it’s just a lot to keep track of at one time.youre just blowing through lip glosses, that's great!Love your nail color 👍💞Your eye makeup looks gorgeous 👍💟It’s great that you are trying to use up your boxycharm products! So many people just end up decluttering them lolCongrats on 2 lippie empties, Ioana! You rocked this update, Beautiful! I love your hair like this, & that pop of pink in your inner corner. Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI don't know if it's my screen but the concealer looks really olive. Unusual to see a light olive concealer!I barely wear any lip things and it took me almost 2 years to finish a mini lipgloss and have so many others.Probably my favorite eye look you've done! Always inspired by your makeup.🎉🎉🎉I enjoyed this update, but next month will be even better! I just know it will be!  Good job Paula!I'm totally going to join in this project on Instagram next year!!! Every month I keep seeing updates for this project and it's so inspiring ♥️Paula you look beautiful and your determination never ceases to amaze me! Love the way you stand by your purchases and commit to the long term relationship that you'll have with them !Maybe you can use the glitter as a topper to the look you are panning. Thats what I do. Great progress overall. Look at you go!That elf contour and lipstick will be done next time. I can feel it 😂🤟🏽 that lip will be cute for fall🧡You are definitely going to have side pan and empty elf and mayyybe the green shade will have pan. Well done on amazing progress. You are honestly so lovely ♥️I love your hair so much!! 💜 💜 💜This and graveyard are awesome projects. I will join next year for sure but then i think I will have panned all the things like cream foundation cream contour, bronzer etc out of my collection... i will have cream blush and highlight for years still but i can only work on one at a time... so lipsticks it is then lol oh and super shock shadows.. i have a shed load of those lol ok I'm good to stay in this project for all eternity now 🤦🏼‍♀️ lol xxxI think you can definitely finish off the little lipstickOh you will totally have that one dark shade in the Elf cream palette done by next update.Lunch money will definitely have side pan... keep working in that lipstick Paula you can do it!So much great progress 🎉I am glad they are bringing this project back bc I really love seeing what everyone is using in it. I am glad you are gonna mix the last 2 shades in that Elf concealer palette to make them work for you. I wanna see that thing empty someday! Lol! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaWould you please consider doing a grwm
With this eye look? It looks fantastic 🙂Always love your updates, even though the project will be back quickly I'm still sad to see this one coming to an end! I love all your projects though.With those Stila liquid shadows, you can use just a tiny bit and pat it over your eyelid over your eyeshadow.  It adds a sheer wash of color, but you need to have eyeshadow under it- you could still pan your look.i think next year i will join this project as well ! i absolutely love moving out my cream productsIt is funny that you are doing better this year with your lip products than last years when you were out and going to work everyday 🥰🥰🤭🤭You look beautiful as always. Cream products are so hard and its certainly teaching us all lessons. I should not buy any more stila glitters 😂 you are making great progress too.I also love the idea of cream products but I just don’t use them enoughWow your eye look 😍You can do it! We believe in you!! <3<3Even if you haven't been as successful as you wanted, you are still learning from the project! That always a good thing.LOVE love love your eyeshadow!So pretty. It is hard to use cream when it doesn’t go with the weather. I haven’t bought a cream product in so long for this reason. You look beautiful. You will be done with that oil in no time.I am trying to use up a cream blush so I use it everytime I do my makeup for about 2 years (about 600 uses) and I think I used up about a third of it. Somebody help me:DI feel like I can always trust you because my country also is humid all year round. Some products recommended by other youtubers don’t work for me.I’m staying away from many cream blushes because they go bad so fast on me.Contour is amazingHello gorgeousYou look beautiful, Jordana 🥰Your entire look is perfect.First!🥳🎉💝💝💝Also, I am so excited to see that palette completely empty!Lipstick is so tough to reach for these days with masks being a huge part of daily life.Love your videos girl!Truth be heard had me cracking up!!!

I would say you could cocktail and mix the blushes together, but you make so much progress on cream blush its actually mind blowing! 🤯🤯Love the video! So fun you get to spend time with your parents. Also I have loved watching the progress you have made on the balm palette! So satisfying!I always love seeing your progress on your apple blush palette. Seeing all of those shiny pans makes me happy. I don’t blame you for working on that palette before the ColourPop blush. The fall blush with the good shimmers is gorgeous!To be honest....Truth Be Heard! Girl, I love you! 😂 I’ve never heard it that way. I’ve always seen it used as To Be Honest. But they kinda mean the same thing if you really think about it. So you’re not really all that wrong either! Have fun visiting with your parents! ❤️That second cream shadow is beautiful! Nice job!Totally just watched this video twice because I zoned out the first time.Both of those eyeshadows are so pretty! And wow, you have done some serious damage on that cheek palette.Hey guys. I hope you are all well. I just found out, that this project will start again next year, so I am super happy! Anyone thinking of joining (again)? ☺😍You are making great progress on difficult progress. I think you'll finish the glitter in less than 4 months. I never heard of the primer but it seems so handy if it were still available.That glitter gel is sooo close!!! YAY!I feel like cream products are harder to work through than anything else! You made pretty good progress on all of them!I am so happy seeing your face. Ive been watching your channel for years so it always is such a big thing that you wanted to do this and are doing it next year. Thank you so much❤Woo-hoo! Amazing empties 🥳And starting off with an empty palette! YESSS!Glad to see you back!!!Missed your beautiful face. In going through my collection, I've realized how many cream products I have. And I never put them in projects 🤔🤔 May need to change that.I like to have at least one Gimme product in a project so I can get at least one empty/success as I loose momentum and interest otherwise.You are looking super sexy, Jess! The make-up, the hair & the cleavage! Lol! Great job! We love empties, & I love you, sweet Friend! So happy you are back! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat progress! Love your eyeshadow in this video. 💜Great job. Love those little Avon lipsticks. They were just enough of a color before I got bored. 😁So excited to see the shimmer palette done!Jessica Lee, Sept. 12, 2020, is the day I'm honoring my father who would've turned 72 years old. He was a baby boomer. He's originally from Virginia like I am. He met my mother in late 1967. They graduated from high school in 1968. They got married on the last day of 1968. He was in the Army in Alabama in most of the 1970's. His air traffic controlling job was assigned in Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia from 1978 to 2004. Afterwards, he was a retired air traffic instructor. He died from severe aneurysm on Feb. 6, 2016, at his age of 67 years. I talked to the Lord about my father's lifetime.Nice work on the new roll ins! 👏🏼🙌🏼Yes. I love items that are easy mixed with tough. Helps my motivation too.Wonderful to see you posting more.  Stay healthy and take care of you.   I love the color pop purple eye linerwell done on the elf palette! yay!Welcome back 😀! It is so good to see you again 😘😘😘I love this project! Even if my progress are so slow 😅 I'll do it next year too! My son will start school this Monday and it will be in presence with masks ecc... I have to take his temperature every day before school and he has to stay at home even with just a bit of runny noseYou are back!!!!!!!!Didn’t know you were back! Hope everything is going well in your life!! Can’t wait to see your pans!!Give me items are the best.  It helps with inventory numbers and also quick.  Way to go.  Best wishes👍Congratulations on finishing that ELF palette!  I’m sure you’ll make a few franken products to fill it back up again. 😂  It’s been nice seeing you post again.Hi Jessica, I will make this project next year, but I decided to stop now to buy like cream eye shadows... For myself I m making a little bag of tiny mini products... I re organise again my products/inventory, but I start to be boring of some like body mist... I also see now what I didn't use at all this year in some project like A to Z made before the covid and lip service is over... But anyway I will use again same nice products next year in long project, even they are not finished and change some of those I m boring... We ll see, in France now it s everywhere mask, so make up is quite impossible... I will try to focus on my eyes now, no choice... Stay safe, happy to see you again your friend from Paris France Sophie ❤️Your kids are learning remotely, also?  That's awesome!  My son was in online school before this- his school has made several comments about all the new students coming in this year.  So many people are switching to online classes.  And then I was very surprised how many families in town want their kids back in in-person school.  My daughter has 20 kids in her class this year (the last two years, there were 13 kids in her class- so they've INCREASED class sizes??)- only two of us in the class have chosen to do remote learning... I'm really surprised!  I get it- small town, less cases.  But only two remote learners??  On the other hand... yes, having another child home has been a big struggle.  lol🥳🥳🥳As if 2020 wasnt hard enough. You poor thing. Im so honoured you feel this way. We are doing it next year with a quarterly refresh. You made wonderful progress.I enjoyed your update Dannie! Stay safe!WOW. Those photos are shocking. I cannot imagine how scary that is.Keep staying safe out there!i think i am definitely going to have to pick up that IT eye liner!  no empties but you've made excellent progress!  your eye makeup is beautiful.  it reminds me of a celestial mermaid tail.Yes!  It is coming back next year!  That small IT eyeliner has some serious value for moneyOh my gosh! I didn't realize that you live CA.  I hope that you and yours stay well and safe!OMG that is so scary.  The moon pic looks cool, but not under those circumstances.  YIKES!!!  We are doing it again next year!!!!  I'm trying to decide if I just want to roll over what I didn't finish or if I want to start fresh.Please stay safeI am so glad that you and your family are safe! It's so unbelievable, and scary. ❤️I love this eye look! I am glad you are safe!Stay safe, thanks for sharing!!I'm thinking of you with the fires. That was us at the beginning of the year, here in Australia.  I live between 3 fires we had.That is so scary. I am terrified of fire. I have been praying for everyone affected. It gets frustrating when you use something so much, & it hardly looks used. On the other hand, it means you are getting your money's worth out of a product. Beautiful eye look! Your wings look amazing! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThat pic of the moon would be beautiful if not for the way  it happenedI hope we are finally gonna control these fires and take measure for them not to happen again, or at least not like this. And I hope new tree are going to be planted. But an update without empties ? I'm shook !!!The fires are so bad that yesterday the sun looked red in the morning, and I’m in AZ! Glad you are safe <3Glad you’re safe, Dannie!  The pics of the fires look unbelievable. You have a couple of tough guys in this project. 🍀🍀I look forward to seeing your progress on them next monthDid you pack any makeup in your emergency bag?These fires are horrible. My son and grandkids evacuated their coastal home in Oregon between Lincoln City and Tillamook. I live in California too our Santa Cruz mountains had 20,000 people evacuated and 900 homes burn. My daughter came very close to evacuating her home near Susanville.I love how you do this project. Id love ab inventory at the end of the year to see the difference if possible haha. The supershocks are stunning.Love it!🥳🎉I freaking love moonwalk!!!You did so good with letting those items go! Good for you!I need to get my hands on that elf stipple brush!Better late than never!My PF liquid blush does not have any grains in it...maybe yours needs to be mixed up a bit?
So funny. I have Telepathy and have never used it either 🙈
I love that your project pans are helping you to declutter so much this year.i like that you are reviewing the products as you go!!That lip product is honestly such a beautiful colour. Its stunning on you. I wonder is there a dupe of that shade because i want it haha. 15 is a  lot particularly when we aren't going anywhere/masks💚❤That new roll in lippie is gorgeous!Congrats on getting to roll in a new product. Oh, my! Another lippie! Lol! Keep up the good work, Gorgeous! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaLove this makeup look 😍 your red lip makes me want to wear a red lip but I have to wear a mask all day at work 😞You are as pretty as can be Ashley🤩❤️🌹✨.Your Parents in Cream project pan is the best💐😘xx!Im soooo curious about that highlighter. You are so close. That's really helpful info about the stick foundation.Also, I love your top!That highlight is soo thin, it seems hard to access it. Can you even "repress it". Still it is sooo satisfying!You are doing so so well. They are tough products and yet you made wonderful progress  👏Yoo are doing great!Nice 😘💐🎉🎉🎉Yay empties. You are doing a great job with your projects!It never ceases to amaze me how you go through products. Bravo👏👏Sometimes I have to drop a super tiny drop of oil on my abh cream contour kit to get it to blend better. It can be a little stiff for me.Seeing you through the container was soooo cute! Made me smile so big!I've been working on a contour from the ABH cream contour palette for months and still haven't hit pan! Honestly don't really love that palette.You always have such good progress.  It is impressive how consistent your usage is.I was at TJ Maxx last week, and they had various First Aid Beauty products, including the lip balm (for $9.99). Maybe you could find it at your TJ Maxx or Marshalls?Nice progress 😍That top looks beautiful on you!How you resisted putting your tiny face in the First Aid jar as your thumbnail, I don't know. You made me laugh so much when you lifted it  🤣 I'm probably adding creamy beige to my project soon but as a bronzer. You are right- it's totally the wrong name.❤️❤️❤️🥳🎉❤️Nice job!You're becoming a panning beast Beth....Great job!Hello 👋 friend I’m here to watch 😁You are doing really good, Beth. I can see progress on the smudge pot & the primer. Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaL🦋ve you tips & everything 😍🥰😘Great progress on those products.Good job, Beth. The primer is really showing some use on it 👍🏼👍🏼Hola chica!! Here to watch girl! 👀💃🏽😌♥️💐Yeah, you use so little of the concealer. Seems like a good value though!The something update. LOL. I love it! It is so hard to keep up with monthly updates! :)I enjoyed your update Lori!I am awful at using eyeshadow sticks.I don't think I would ever get anywhere with cream products except foundations & concealers. I can finish those pretty quickly. Lol! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI've just finished a tasty lip gloss too. It was a 2ml Rimmel metallic gloss in a bronze/copper shade. I loved the finish, colour and texture.  The only problem was that it had that floral taste which reminded me of my late grandmother's floral perfume.  Floral and metallic just don't seem to match.great videoThat Laura Geller palette looks really nice!I have a similar problem once in a while. I don't have many friends that are into makeup, so I can't declutter to anyone. But I don't blame you at all for deciding to not hate pan something.Same! Where did August go!!!You could def. hit pan on that blush soon!You look so pretty!Love the sound effect! Great update! Yay for a roll in!I love your background!😍 Also yes, the North does remember 😂that sentence made me smile 😄Great progress :)The Hades palette is so prettyYou're doing great Nat!117 uses! Wow. Sucks that it was useless. Good riddance!Well one thing about working from home is you don't have to get out in that heat as much ❤.  Love your backgroundI moved two items out into the garbage. 😂 I heard the Inky List retinol was good but  it has dimethicone in it. I don't do well with dimethicone. That lip looks like a fun fall color. You're doing so well!You are doing so well with this one, Nat! I wish I liked cream products more. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHello 👋 I made it lol 😂 happy 😃 SaturdayI love your background 🤩🔥👍🏽🥳🎉💙You have made really steady progress on hard products. That lip lacquer is lovely on you.Great steady progress Linda!!!🎉🎉🎉That lip colour is gorge on you!Your makeup looks so pretty today! Good work on your products!I love the color that you are wearing on your lips today.جميله جداI think a Rennaisance fair would be so cool. You are doing really well with this project. Yup, that primer will definitely be done by the end of the yr. Love ya, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI'll probably dress up for Halloween but watch a movie at home with Bo alone. 😅 Sweden has never been big in Halloween.❤️❤️❤️❤️This is true. No idea what will happen for halloween. Im loving your look and you're making great progressI love the lip color, Ashley! You're making steady progress on everything which honestly is a blessing for a year that has thrown us so many obstacles!

I laughed out loud at the eyeshadow update "who is surprised?!" 🤣I'm a Renaissance nerd too! Mine would've been like two weekends ago.🎉🎉🎉1st!! According to my planner I need to record this today...we'll see how that pans out 😀
Aww the candle ♥️That bronzer is A MONSTER, crazy!!! So my guess went totally wrong...maybe 224😅Man, I used to want that Chanel bronzer so bad, but somehow didn't end up buying it when I was a shopaholic. I would have never finished it anyway. You did amazing!Great progress! The cerave Mattifying spf 30 sunscreen moisturizer is so good. I bought mines at ulta.YAY I love that you are going to have an empty within days of this update!! DANG 214 uses and still no pan?I cannot get over this bronzer haha what great value👏Very good job!!!! I got though using up my  Grainier skin active moisturizer rescue and my tarte smooth operator powder!!!!200 times holy cow lol that’s a lot lolYou're doing really well!! I can't wait to join you guys next year!Ok I'm super excited for you to hit pan on the chanel bronzer. Like when that happens I will be super thrilled for you. You are doing so great with the cream products friend.Hope you hit pan on the Chanel bronzer 🙌🏻That's so exciting abt the Chanel bronzer. I have always wanted to try it. It's just so expensive, but with how many uses you are getting out of it...it seems like it is worth the price. Stay safe, Beautiful! TFS! ~ NonaGreat job rolling something out. Crossing fingers you do hit pan soon on that bronzer!!You look fantastic! Great lip colour!That ciate glitter is sooo pretty!I cannot believe there is no pan. I'll be sooo excited to see that jar!We are going to need to throw you a party when you finish that bronzer 🥳🥳
Love all the progress you made, that category liquid shadow is so pretty!🥳🎉💜Great update! Yay for an empty!I feel you with allergies!! I am struggling here too!This project is really fun, isn´nt it?! You are doing great - 👏👏👏 for an empty! More product in those small sized lipstick than you think.I have products in this project that seems to last forever! And probably I'll put them again next year 😅Awesome progress!👏🏽Lol I'm only doing 3 products. I think having less products in this particular project is better.bI need to join the 2nd season of this.yay for an empty!! :)I like the color you have on your eyes and lips.   You must have had a lot of those Avon lip samples, I always see them in your projects.  Sometimes that size is all you need because lipsticks last forever!!!  Great progress so far and yes anytime you finish up or get use out of your items is always a happy time!!!  Good luck on this project see you next time.I agree, the tiniest empty is a plus!  My cream products that I am panning are lasting and lasting. And lasting!  Lol!  A little goes a long way with some of them!Well done on your empty 👏my scales doesn't do decimal points so im in the same boat 😂💚Your eye look is gorgeous today, Jess! Great progress too:) and I’m with you on appreciating the little things. We gotta take what we can get this yearJessica, that brow mousse has SO MUCH product in it!! I've been using mine for over a year with no end in sight and the label completely rubbed off! LOL.Congrats on the empty, Jess! I love your eye look! That blue tho! Lol! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI have that problem of liking products I'm making myself use up, too (let's not mention that blue eyeshadow, though... there are exceptions to everything).In love with your eye look!Preah re this year.. eyeliners take foreverOh first hereLet me know if you like this lighting. If not window behind me it is 👍🏼I felt that so hard when you talked about lighting. Having been someone who used to film with a white wall, then got bored with it and wanted a fuzzy background. I don't know if people know how much work it is to film with natural lighting and make sure things don't look off colors. 

Do you use a grey card? If the sun is going in and out, in theory, you have to reset white balance everytime the temperature changes. Not worth the drama, AT ALL. 

Honestly, I don't know why anyone would* complain as long as it's not a tutorial, who cares! *Sorry for the rant lol*Are you doing the end of the year makeup empties?I prefer the lighting the other way. Love your videos and will watch no matter 💜Great job as always!!Such a great update Alex!!!I completely understand what you want in a primer. I want the same!!!I think this lighting is unflattering for you and makes the video less appealing. I watch your videos anyways, but that is simply my thought.Way to go using up that still highlight! So impressive!I like this lighting better but I’ll watch no matter what lollove the hair, alexI like how the lighting looks!I like this lighting :) it looks very natural...real and not oddly color saturated. But of course, do what makes you happy 😃 I’ll watch you no matter what the lighting. As for those who vehemently complain, like, really? Bigger issues in the world.I think the lighting is good both ways but it does seem a bit less warm this way than with the window behind you. Colors seemed a little more saturated, but this also may be a little more true to the actual irl appearance?I like the light, very flattering and soft!
I am trying to use up two lipglosses (a purple glittery and a fiery orange glittery), skinny tube like yours but it will take me ages to use them up XD
Also my face spf 50 and my spf 50 stick for the undereyes, I freak out at the idea of using them after months and to have them expire, I rather declutter them after using them until it's dark and gloomy here in ItalyWell wow to those empties. It is definitely not cheating. I like all the lighting 💚💖💖That’s awesome progress ! That highlighter omg ! I’m thinking I’ll be able to finish a few more products next update but I loved my update on this one ! ☺️❤️ will be posting in about an hour ⚡️🥳🎉You are still making great progress for not wearing makeup for those days!!👍I don’t notice anything off with the lighting.  I think it looks fine, and I thought it looked find the other way too!  Lip products have to be the hardest thing to pan right now.  The one thing I can say about mask wearing, I am using up a liquid lipstick in a color that I don’t like.  The formula is very drying and lasts under the mask and doesn’t transfer all over the place.  When this one is done, I have three other colors in the same formula!How are you using MAC shell all over your face? Like a primer before foundation? I have that product too so I am very curious so I can try as well.You look so beautiful with this eye/hair combo!!!Leave your criticism downstairs 😁 I'mma start saying that when someone gives me sass though!Honestly, I like this lighting. It's all personal preference....The reason I like this lighting is because the natural light looks the most 'real' and that's what I like best. 

Btw, your blue top looks so pretty on you❤️❤️❤️The lighting is a little dimmer but realistic 👍 I also had a sample of the Mac primer and loved it and my skin is normal to dry but my nose still gets shiny and this primer stopped it. ❤️❤️I always enjoy your content, make yourself happy with the lighting. I enjoy the outdoor view, but whatever works best for you.Love that lip color your wearing.🙂Your lighting is just fine. You make such amazing progress on those liquid blushes. YES mama!! 2 empties!!!I feel the same with Nara blush. I love at the time of the application but then it fades a lotCongrats on finishing 2 productos!! Whooo hooooo!!  The lighting looks a lil darker than usual but its still okay visually.💖💖💖You always make me laugh so much 😂 first if all who cares what people say about your lighting, people will always have something to complain about 🙄.   My goal in life is to see you finish one of those liquid blushes 😂. That’s so awesome that you’ve used up that stila highlighter, makes me wanna get one just to pan it 🤭😆. Congrats on your two empties!!Hi Alex, honestly I have to see more videos with you in this lighting before it's this isn't working lol. Great work with the roll out in this video 👍I feel the lighting was better with the window behind you.  But I love your videos so will watch no matter where you film!  🤓I think the old lighting was way better but keep it like that if you like it. I will watch you anyway❤Honestly I liked both spots. Yesterday's and today's. I must not have a great eye for color. 🤷#1 You look amazing in blue!  #2 I am starting new projects and have basically said I'm copying you! 🤪 Congrats on using up those 2 items.i've also been using my remaining coloured eye pencils as bases, otherwise - they don't move at all!  i love your eye makeup with that lip!  congrats on another empty!yay on finishing a non-cruelty-free item!🥳🎉💝Yay! That the liner works as an eyeshadow base!! Such a great update Dannie!111 times!!! Holy cow!I love empty tubessss!!!! YES!!!Hooray for getting through all of your Lip Glass!!!Congrats on finishing the lip glass, Gorgeous! You are doing amazing! Which is no surprise to me. Lol! Loving your neutral eye look, & I love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaIf you're interested, the peach scrub is 15.0 mL/0.51 fl. ozI love your eyeshadow looks you always do. They are so glamorous.

Well done on the liner😲 im so curious about the cream bronzer progress hahaGreat progress as always Dannie and this eye look is stunning xGreat update! You are really getting along with this project!Wow, Dannie! Amazing progress on that eyeliner!! 😳🎉💜How are you finding panning your cream/liquids??yaaay so excited for the new round and THANKYOU for the refresh😆😆You look amazing in red!  I can't wait to join this project next year. You have 8 super shocks and I think I have 30 🤣You look stunning in red!Love you in red!! I still want that ND face palette.I don’t remember the last time I’ve finished a polish or at all 😅You are doing so well, as always!That set to stun SS is stunning!That pan has definitely expanded on that cream highlight.  Oh I actually like that Catrice polish.  That is a me kind of shade. lolI'm loving this red look!  I think your project is going so well and I love the inclusion of nail colors.  That second one you are rolling in looks amazing.Yoúre doing great and you have really difficult products in this project. Cute look today 💕Red really looks good on youLove this idea of a cream product project pan :) you are amazing 💕I wish I looked that good in red. My grandmother wore red so well. I can do certain pinks. You're doing really well! Totally doing this next year too.You look fabulous, Steph! My word, but you are beautiful! I hate it when you can see obvious expansion of the pan, but the scale doesn't register it. Lol! Keep up the good work, Sweetie! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaLove the red shirt with the makeup you’re wearing. It’s very pretty. That’s such a good idea to put nail polish in this project. I may do that next year.The lip color is amazing on you! You’re seriously making me wish I would of bought that ND palette! The longer/thinner Essie bottles I’m not a fan of, curious to see if you like it as much as the regular formula. This video was WAY too short for me. I just need to hear you talk 24/7. You should do a live stream where I just hear you talk alllllll day!!!i’ve recently discovered you because i’m doing my own PP and like to get inspo from others, and i’m not sure why but watching you really chills me out i love it 🥰 really like your videos steph 🧡 plus i’m currently trying to use up liquid highlighter and i’ve been putting a couple of drops in my moisturiser every day under foundation!! i love it. xxThis is something I definitely need to do! I have some super shock shadows and some cream and liquid shadows that I kinda forget about but I absolutely love!! This would really help me use my products. You look so lovely in red!! Much love to you!😘😘😘How do you work in cream panning with other project pans ? I'm confused. I would like to try my hand at project pan but would love some advice on how to get started.Your red lip is great! Not sure if you’ve ever tried the Bite formula, not their bullet lipstick but it’s a melted lipstick? Recommend it if you see it in Ireland. Keep up your good work on panning. You’re doing so well. Hope you have a good day, take care.U have a mixed language.....its like u have an accent from another country but only at some points during talking but then the rest of the time u  sound much more like how i talk 😁????I’ll be posting my update later today ! So excited to see the bigger pan on the Huda palette. I’ll be joining next year, will you write the new rules on the ig group ? ❤️You look stunning in red!! Great update as always, a lot of expanded pans 😍Oooh. Look at you in all this red. 😍 I am loving the red lip. It really suits you. 

You're making such good progress with everything! 🙌 Set To Stun is one of my favorite Supershock shades. I love how you've paired it for this eyelook.So many fun products. It’s nice to see you working on your nail polishes. That ND blush is beautiful. I wonder how long until you get fed up and get an 0.1g capable scale. 🤣the whole red look is amazing!! love it! great job using your polishes!Looking good in red!Beautiful products!! 
I would love to join in the next round!It makes so much sense to focus on creams since they can go bad more quickly. I just started my very first project pan series on my channel. I’m so new to this, I’m over here taking notes 😅 scale, count uses, close up pics, tell me more lol 🧡I can’t seem to stick to my cream products. I only have a few but I find them hard to reach for consistently. Maybe if I start with just one. My cream highlighter.I am almost ready To join you in the next round!!! 
Sending love your way ❤️Oooooh i should start mixing my primer with foundation too! I also have large pores and wrinkles forming lolGreat job finishing up that primer. I love the ofra liquid lips tooThe ofra formula is super nice I enjoy it as well! My go to from them was the shade mocha! Your lips but better 😊Wow! That empty is a huge bottle! Well done!!Great job finding a way to make the foundation work for you, Gorgeous! Keep up the good work! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaLove your makeup today!I have a foundation that I am trying to finish that is the bit too full coverage and a little to dry. I will have to try mixing it with the primer! Thanks for the idea!I love that you found a way to make the Becca foundation work for you. I’m the same way. I try a lot of different ways to use an item to see if I can make it work.Yessss! Great job finishing that primer! I still haven’t tried that one yet... good for dry skin?I despise that Becca foundation! I’ve tried mixing it with other foundations recently and I’m not minding it. I think I’ll try mixing it with a moisturizer or moisturizing primer! What do you mix it with that helps it work better for you?P.s. you always have amazing nail polishes. Would be nice to see a video about them. Also do you ever project pan them? I’m sure it’s pretty imposible that’s why I never see people doing them. Great video as always.Woah😍 I love love love your makeup look here So soft, beautiful and perfect for autumn. I might have to try and recreate. Do you prefer pan or powder products in general?What a pretty look you are wearing today! I love when you make these soft looks 😊🥳🥳🥳I wonder what would happen if you did a boxycharm project pan🧐🤔🤔🤔..... love the look btw😻🤗🤗🤗Hello beautiful!! Loving this makeup! I'm about to sign back up for Boxy 😁 I think lol
Excellent progress my frnd!🦄I really like your makeup today!

At the end of the year, will you do a recap video of how many Boxycharm items you've kept, used up, or decluttered? Or, if you don't have time for that, will you do a grouping of products from Boxycharm in your end of the year empties recap?This is one of my favorite eye looks I’ve seen on you! So beautiful and sleek.
Edit: I’m hoping to join this project in January! I’m so excited 😁 and I have a ton of Boxycharm products I should probably pan, too 😂I've never tried ofra liquid lipsticks but im curious. I know I've said it before but i love your background 💚Hooked on your videos.omg your nails look amazing! that is so cool! such great progress!Im an 'over user' of setting sprays too!Great empties woohoo 🎉 love when that happensThat new spf used to be my favorite, but it can be a little too drying for me in Swedish fall and  winter.You have such good progress this update!I also tried Rebecca's nail technique this week! She is so great!That was a feat to finish the Volourpop highlighter. Great value for it lasting 9 months. Great progress, Beautiful! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYou look so beautiful and classy! Love it!Great job Tash 👍 I just bought Lunch Money yesterday, I’ve already gone through one as well.Do you have any tips on how to use up the colourpop highlighters quicker? I have two of their cream ones.  I’ve been using them for over a year and I’m nowhere close to hitting pan 😫Lovely nails!! 😍💙 So Tash mentioned that she finished Lunch Money in about 9 months with regular use (and it already had some use before the project started). Somewhere in my mind I'm telling myself that I can also finish my Lunch Money highlighter... because I think I bought it in February? Maybe even earlier than that... I've since used it twice... so yes I'm definitely going to finish it in another 9 months ha, ha, ha LOL! 😂😅🤣🤪Very curious how a matte will work out on the nails. I kinda agree with the scented products, I don't like when the scent changes.Amazing progress!Congrats on finishing lunch money!Amazing progress! Love this project, everyone is doing great and using up a whole Colourpop highlighter is incredible!. If you cut open a sunscreen It will most likely lose the spf when exposed, you can still use it up as a moisturizer but It won´t give sun protection. Love from Argentina :)Awesome progress! 👏🏽🥳🥳🥳Thank you for always inspiring me to be a conscious consumer and use what I already own. I love keeping up with your makeup journey!!Amazing update!!It takes me forever to use up perfumes but body mist i fly right through themWow!!!! That CP LUNCH MONEY!!! Amazing work!! 🥳🥳❤️👏👏 Congrats on finishing up that highlighter! Plus the other empties! I feel the same about scented lip products. I have a couple of lip crayons from Laura Geller that probably need to go. They've always smelled like vanilla, but instead of smelling off, the scent has gotten really strong.Such a great month for you! Lots of empties :)I am the same way with my setting spray! I know it probably isn’t the best for my skin, but I just love dousing my whole face with it!That Australian gold sunscreen is my all time favorite! It’s the best affordable, mineral sunscreen with a high spf that I’ve ever found :)I love this video! This is inspiring me to do a lip products pan! Thank youIm glad you mentioned your nails because i thought they were beautiful. What colour did you use as a base? Well done on all the exciting progress. I really want to try flower beauty.i saw Rebecca's video and have wanted to do that nail trick it looks so pretty, i have not done it yet but I want to! your nails turned out so well!You rock a green lip so well. That new super shock shadow is beautifulI love the way you put your eye make up. time for me to learn how to put my own make up in a different style of application.Omg seriously taking us longer to get ready to film some videos 😅 great update that super shock shadow you rolled in is pretty cool!Maybe try putting the new purple super shock shadow all over the lid, and then top it with Sea Siren? I think that would look AMAZING! Great update as always 😊I love it that you are rockin' that green lip! #Yassssssssss! Pan is pan even if it's illegitimate. Lol! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI have been mixing argan oil to bring my colourpop cream blushes back to life! It’s great for that!.🥳🎉💝💝I need to join season 2 definitely 2 goals completedGreat with two goals met!!! I hoped you would declutter that dry Colourpop thing. - and you did 😂😂😂 You could put that cool toned Stila eyeshadow in the next years project 👍 You will probably use it more then.Im thinking that new beautiful super shock with sea siren on it?? Illegitimate pan haha. I love your hair and the green. You are honestly such a joy.this is me saying hello in the comments :)Love the moonwalk shadowI also love how short these are to film. Definitely doing this next year too. Nice work on the body spray and the dry supershock. I had to toss one of mine recently too. It was just crumbling. I think I'm down to 3 supershocks. I need to work on my bigger Stila shadows. Gotta finish that last mini first though! <3love the forest green lip on you!I love the green lipstick you’re wearing!  I think the purple SSS you rolled in is beautiful. I can’t wait to see what looks you come up with using it.GAH I love the green lip!!!!  If you have any face oil like jojoba, organ, etc you can easily revive the CP SSS. Makeup.Just.For.Fun has an excellent video on how she revived hers with a drop of oil.“Illegitimate pan”. Best phrase ever! 😂Use the supershock with the sea siren shade and do neutral everything else! If you can pull off that green lipstick you can pull off that shadow :) You are doing great project panning is always harder nearing the last chunk of the year and you have a lot going!Girl!! I am loving that green!! I wish I could pull that off ❤️❤️ what brand is that?إيه الجمال دهI think you can definitely finish that Mary Kay  lip scrub by next month!Great job! I love the VS scents I need to get one again it’s been awhile!Oh man! I think my CP Cruella jelly much shadow is done too

Oh Prickly Pear is beautiful.You’ve done such a great job! 2020 is utterly the worst year to pan lipsticks for sure.You are really doing so well with this project.  Very impressive update.2.01 grams is fantastic! Well done!!Much better to have a full cream palette - great idea to  move it! I thought it looked like a little bum, and you said it 😂😂😂 Great progress!Omg Hélène 😲i cannot get over how much product you used up. Thats incredible 👏Oh that foundation is so close.Stick blushes are neverending I mean, just keep it that in mind and don't get frustatedI love the spooky vibes from the makeup and background! Stunning! Loved the update!🥳🎉🥳Has anyone else noticed that the lighting has been a little weird in the last few videos?Love Love love your makeup look 😍 I always enjoy project pan videos the most 😊 I‘m working my way through a cream blush at the moment, feels so good to see progress. Hope you have a great day 💕It’s so cool to see your physician’s formula foundation nearing its end! I feel like I’ve been on a journey w it lol awesome update!!!Holy crap. A whole weekend with Christina :) plus we get one Tuesday too because of our Harry Potter Project Pan 🙃 thats 6 in a row whooooooI'm so glad I'm not the only one who puts the use month in the title. I can't keep track if it the update number doesn't match the month number. lol 
It did take me a bit to get halfway through the ColourPop blush stick. I have a 10 use goal a month on my creams and I didn't use it that many times each month. I had it in since the start of this project and met my goal in Sept.  I just double checked. It was about 60 uses for me. Curious to see your numbers! Loving this project!Sending you good panning vibes💜💙💚Speaking my language with the “spread it everywhere just to get rid of it”.   I tried last night with a lotion but finally had to tell myself to stop or I was going to slip right out of bed 😜.  It will be done tonight 🙌🏻.  Thanks for sharing!Hey, I am also trying to finish that foundation and I would be very happy to know how did you take out the stopper 🥺I really like the crescent light in your background! I'm not sure if you did anything else differently, but your overall lighting seemed really great in this video.You guys did a perfect job with the September project pan, happy weekend Christina❤❤❤🌟!I love your makeup today!! 😍😍 that lip gloss is so pretty!! Woohoo for finishing up that oil top🥳🎉💝That lip gloss is gorgeous! Also, yay for the oil empty!! That is a difficult product!  You have good progress! I look forward to the next update!🗣💄 doing well on your products!🛌The cream blush looks like such a nice colour. You'll get there. They are tough products to go through but you made great progress. The nars lippie will be lovely on youCream products are really tough to make progess-love your attitude towards it!You’re stunning today! Whether you finish those 3 products or not, it’s definitely not a failure since you’ve got so many uses out of products you might not otherwise:) 💄(The CT lipstick name come to my mind whenever I hear pillow talk.)I’m loving  this look! Wow!You are doing a great job!There’s no such thing as a failure if you’re making progress 😉😆help me out with picking products for next round! im so stumped! I cant make a decision for any project next year!That last bit is so close to done I can get behind the "calling it good" and ditching itFriend, you are very beautiful. Will you befriend me?...I love the color of your lipstick but i don't know for some reason it doesn't look good on my lips.  Awesome reviews.Loved the update Kailee!That lipstick is beautiful!I love that you already picked out next year's items!!!Hello vampy lips! 😍 The shade looks amazing on you!

That is super satisfying to see the empty MAC Paint Pot! 🙌Progress is progress! I would be awful at this. Luckily I like to declutter and I get bored easily so I don't have much that overstays its welcome. Full support, keep in touch!You look gorgeous, Kailee! It was so super satisfying to see that paint pot wiped clean. Lol! Awesome stuff right there! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI’m already starting to plan next year’s projects too 😄🙈Bahaha " duh, that's the finale" 😅😅🎊💜🎊 FIRSTI love your eyeshadow colours, the contrast works so well with brown eyes. 🥰 I am also loving autumn colours these days. But it’s good to do a short video, something most people can relate to 💖 I love watching videos that are short and state - 10min get ready with me because it teaches others how to apply make up quick 🥰 loved this video thou.Good for you for getting rid of something that doesnt work!!Look at you throwing something out. I’m proud! That Marc Jacobs highlighter is beautiful. Just move quick with it cause it setsUgh. Thank you for getting rid of the face pallet that wasn't working for you. I get so frustrated with panners who keep stuff that they dislike but feel they have to use. I'm always telling them through the TV "throw it out". LOL 😆Great update Rebeca!Bummer that the contour kit didn't work for you, but I understand letting it go.I do really enjoy your content. But when I hear someone say "oh God" it makes me want to turn the video off. I've never heard you say it before. It surprised me. Just saying because I appreciate watching you.I love that MJ highlighter. I apply it with a sponge under my foundation. Sometimes I mix it with my glossier cloud paints if I want a shimmery blush.I really like your eyelook in this video.  I agree sometimes things just have to move out of the collectionREMOVE THE CONCEALER KEEP THE PALLATE!!Impressive pan on the color tattooNobody has 10 extra minutes just to blend out one step of their makeup routine.How do you pan so much in a month?!?! Lol it’s so impressive!Congrats on your progress! I think decluttering it was wise:) why waste time on things you don’t enjoy?Great update. Eyeshadow pots take a long time to finish, I'm really impressed with your progress.I agree with another commenter! You can depot the concealer shades and keep the palette with the bronzer/contour shadesCongratulations on taking a stand with that palette 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.  Sometimes tough love is the answer 💞.   Took me years to finally click in to only buying exactly what I know works for me and makes me happy.   Love your videos and wishing you a beautiful weekend 🌺I hated the Marc Jacobs highlighter! I felt like it broke up my foundation. I’m curious to see how you use it.just throw out the concealer shades and keep the palette with the bonzers/contours🎉🥳💝I def. think rolling out products and working on things that fit your life better makes a ton of sense. We have to do what we can these days!It’s okay to not have much progress. Life is crazy right now for everyone, so you don’t need to apologize. We all understand. 😊 I’m currently panning my MAC paint pot and it looks like you’re about half way to the bottom of the jar. The paint pots last a long time which is good because they are pretty expensive.I enjoyed your update! I hope work is going well!Yay!! That empty pan!!! Wooo hooo!There's going to be a break in December and a new start in January! So glad this is going on next year too! That palette is almost empty! yay! Way to go on the sunscreen! I have hair oils that need to sit and then be washed out. I am a morning shower person and that's the first thing I like to do. lol I don't think I'll get hair oil treatments like that ever again. You're doing well making progress!
I'm glad you had fun with your husband! Totally need to have fun these days. <3🥳🎉💝Look at the progress woo-hooFresh hair!!!  Lots of great progress this update. I feel exactly the same way about liquid illuminators.  I just don't need them in my collection or my life.I'm so glad someone prompted you to work on another liquid illuminator, I was wondering the same thing my self ;)Great update Paula!!!"I can drag a product out pretty well." LOL Same girl! Same!!! :)PAN!!!Love love love your hair!!!You got your hair done! It looks good! :) Nice work on the empty! That lip product is finally DONE! :D Good option to roll in the liquid illuminator. That mini size hopefully should go fairly quickly. :)Love your hair with that eye look!LOVE your eyeshadow, Paula!!Wow, wow, wow, 
wow for the hair, the eyes! And the bare minerals and I’m only 2.20 minutes into the video 👌😘Purple and vibrant!  Four empties so far, you are doing great!  My cream products are standing the test of time being on average I only wear makeup two days a week.🥳🥳🥳Woo-hoo empty lippie. Happy dance. Lunch money is like watching the evolution of the moon.  For some of my liquid illuminator I add to lotions. Gives a nice glow on my legs and armsI’ve done that before too and get so mad 🤣 love your eye look today.

Have your kids always known you with purple hair? 💜Oh my days thats massive progress on lunch money 😁😁😁 when you've finished it what will be your cream highlight of choice? The stick one? XxxYour hair and your makeup are gorgeous. Oh, that Physician's Formula creme duo...two years of my life and I used them both the same time. I was using the light as an eye shadow primer, then I mixed the two with the little brush that came with it, then just the green by itself. Good to see you, have a good night and enjoy the rest of the weekend.You look beautiful!O-M-G!!! I'm "demanding" a GRWM for this look!!!!! 😍😍 You look amazing!! ❤

Your dog is beautiful ☺️Nice progress I can tell you're working hard. Your daughter is so adorable I'm going to squeeze her and smooch all over her cheeks! Also, thanks for considering Humanity in regards to your colour-pop Super Shock🤣🤣You are doing so good! I hope you keep this spin on the project next year!I’m thinking about joining this project next year. It has been so fun to watch all the progress throughout the year.Oh, bummer...I love that eye look on you!!  😁I want to try that Mac blush formula so bad! ❤️ I always love your updates! It so fun ot see so many products and hear your thoughts!🎉🎉🎉So glad you are back!! Good progress  😊Also, you have such good progress this update! Well done!I totally understand having to adjust back to life after traveling home. I say take your time, and listen to your emotions for sure.would love to see a video of you making a cream shadow out of a stila glitter & glow if you do it again!! i’m very interested to try that!Girl your hair is soooo cute! I love it! Im sorry that you had that bump in the road. But we are here for you beautiful!I am so happy to see your glorious, beautiful self. I am so happy that you did whats best for you and didnt feel under pressure to the point where you did film. I totally understand those feelings and wanting to feel miserable. I too have been feeling that way but i feel guilty about it so im pretty proud of you if that means anything. You miss your family, they are a long way away and it was years since you saw them. If you feel like crap you are perfectly entitled to feel like crap. You are truly wonderful. I did check your channel a few times to make sure i hadn't missed anything. You are making fantastic progress so you are. If there comes a time that another stila dries up and your making a shadow like that, id love to see you do it. ❤💛💚So I was subscribed to you and for some reason when I clicked on this video it showed that I wasn’t subscribed anymore.So glad to see you in my feed tonight!!! 💜💜💜Good to know about the Stila and glow eyeshadows I have two I haven’t been using.  Awesome 👏 side pan in that cream blush!  You are almost done with that whole palette 👏👏👏It's so good to see you on here again.  I've missed seeing your videos, but I'm glad you got to spend time with your family.   I understand how it can put you in a funk after you get back home.  I hope you're able to get in a better head space soon.Welcome back. I understand the feelings because I am living across country from my family as we sell our house and buy a new one. Great video.It's so nice to see your face again! I can relate to the emotional rollercoaster aspect of the past few weeks/months. Hang in there and be kind to yourself 💙 Last but not least, great job with panning!Glad to see you back and you are doing great - cream products are super hard to use right now and honestly they take a long time to use. LOL about the lipstick. Also I felt that since I have added so many things lip product wise recently...oops.its always wild to me (because it happens to me, too) that our minds and bodies sometimes need to just unload and be miserable for a little while. I completely understand where you're coming from but I have to tell you, its so good to see you back!

I always love seeing your content and just hearing from you in general.So glad to see you again!Good to have you back!I went to my best friends wedding last month in Florida and cried when I was on my way back to Texas.. I completely understand your feelings 💝Nice to see your face again.  Hang in there 💪🏼❤️Yayyyy!!! Mah Bae is back!! 🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝Good job getting to roll in new products. I have always wanted to try the Butter London jelly shadows. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaMy jelly much dried out too. Great progress!!🥳🎉❤️❤️Sooo relatable! Thinking you love something, but then panning it makes you question that!Better late than never! I am always slow to getting around to viewing everyone's video!I love the buxom glosses too! It’s been awhile since I’ve gotten one. I’m not enjoying the poreless putty primer as much as the tarte primer. Do you find it helps with your pores? I admire you for using what you have!  I hope you had a great weekend. Hope to see you soon! MonaI loved the color combinationOh i love the color combination in your eyes😍😍 so pretty👍👍👍I just bought my firsy color pop gel glitter omg that's pretty i need to try one of those eyeshadows 🤩😍
Omg girl i usually only lotion up exposed skin arms n legs i forget the rest  😳 i wonder if they have a spray body lotion moisturizer, like that of a sunscreen spray bottle that's the only way i would be able to do all in one lol 😆Your doing great! 😀Hi 👋I been wanting to try the Elf putty primer. Great video.👍Nice progress! Project ends December 10 and restarts January 10.

I have the same smudge pot and I was going to use it as a base, but now I'm worries about that plan. Does it not hold up well?

That's such a bummer that those jelly shadows from ColourPop dry up so quickly! You're doing so well though! 🎉You are so good at using lip items! I enjoyed your update Emelie!I have always been interested in trying that milk primer, but I don't think I'd like sticky either. Interesting!Congrats on your progress. Absolutly 😍 your background. Have a good day !🥳🎉💙I love your background! Such a great update Nat!Good MorningLipstick love,  look at the use, you go girlYou are doing so well, Nat! Loving your neutral eye look! It's beautiful! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHappy Saturday 😁Let the binging beginYay for progress!! I love your spin on a title!!!Great progress! That packaging on the UD lipstick is so beautiful!Hi Nat! Second!First!!!!! You are doing a great job hun!That blush packaging is so cute! And I love an orange blush! Such a good product for this fall!I like seeing you more giggly.  I always feel goofy filming in general as well as thumbnail pictures. LOL!Do u mean 9 sep or 9 Oct?Enjoyed your update Tabitha!That highlight stick has come so far!Slow and steady wins the race.  At least you have progress.Steady progress like usual! Great job Tori!If only food could solve all my problems like your cat. LOLWhat a great finale Katariina!!! Thank you so much for panning with us!!!That elf bronzer palette has awesome progress!!!! Yay!!!!!I completely understand lipstick panning fatigue! In the future, I want to only pan lipsticks that are almost done! It get exhausting panning the same thing forever!I'm really interested in trying this project. Your progress is really impressive. I'm relatively new at panning and I always try to put in a lip product but I have yet to finish one. I get sick of them or resent using them after a while! I think I might join this project in 2021, but probably put a usage goal in place incase I decide an item isn't worth panning.🥳🎉💝Good job finishing 2 pans in the Elf contour palette. Nice finale, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat job finishing off two pans in the ELF contour palette!  🎉🎉 I completely understand why you’re ending this project. I enjoyed following your progress in this project.It makes sense to do the finale if you don't have a lot of cream products in your collection.U ARE SO PRETTY! You did a great job! Really enjoyed watching! Cant wait to see more from you!😍 Rang the bell and joined U❤❤❤❤I really like that you set smart goals! I enjoyed your update!I think you are making great progress!Yay  good luck 4 next update babe.You are doing so good! I love that Marc Jacobs highlighterGood job as always, Rebeca!Awesome progress!!! Can't wait to see more updates for this project. This one has been very fun, i'm  not sure where I am with mine until but definitely excited! :DWhen does next year's project start I'm definitely joining in!You got this!! 💪💪💪Such good progress! Especially that cream shadow! Nice!I’ve gone through 2 full size of the dew you MJ highlighter. Get the smaller kit. It takes me over a year (closer to 2) to go through a full size.I think you are making great progress!Yay  good luck 4 next update babe.You are doing so good! I love that Marc Jacobs highlighterGood job as always, Rebeca!Awesome progress!!! Can't wait to see more updates for this project. This one has been very fun, i'm  not sure where I am with mine until but definitely excited! :DWhen does next year's project start I'm definitely joining in!You got this!! 💪💪💪Such good progress! Especially that cream shadow! Nice!I’ve gone through 2 full size of the dew you MJ highlighter. Get the smaller kit. It takes me over a year (closer to 2) to go through a full size.How are you finding panning the creams? hahaIm def participating in 2021!I have the exact same problem with highlighters and the best way to overcome it is apply highlighter first (even before bronzer to make it even more seamless) I saw DaLin also talk about her doing the same thing too! It's definitely a technique I also discovered last yeyar!That highlighter really lasts! And that blush... 😅 That palette looks so nice - you should pan it if you feel like it. Have the same problem with my scale, only shows full grams, should buy a new one too. That blue Nail polishens looks so nice. Hope you like them (my Ciate minis was good at first but the second half was not, maybe they were old). Good luck with your exams - maybe you are already done 😊You are good and the green nail polish was beautiful :) I am also bad at painting my nails at the moment: / (and I am a nail designer). Sorry I have not seen all your videos lately or commented, I have been packing I have bought an apartment :) Moving in November 17th :) I will be more active again when I have moved into the new apartment) Many hugs from Ida (in Norway)You've got some beautiful products in! :) That Huda cream is moving along slowly! Also, the ND palette is expensive. If you want to pan it, pan it. Get your money's worth out of it. :)That Catrice shade is definitely a me shade! lol  How rude that a polish dared to break in transit!! Dang 73 uses and it is still kicking.  I'd just enjoy that ND face palette awhile before you try to pan it.  Sometimes I start to get sick of things I pan so I don't like to subject loved products to that resentment.  lolI think if you're enjoying that ND blush palette so much that you should pan it next year if you want! 🙌 Remember, we're panning things we love and want to in 2021. 😉You are such a great panner, Steph. I love watching your updates. I am so glad y'all are bringing this project back for the new yr. It's definite;y a good one. Prayers for your exams! Love you, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI know what you mean. I was thinking about panning my Jackie Aina palette for 2021, because I know I will really enjoy it. Then I think I should pick something older like a Kat Von D palette,  but I know I wont like it as muchThat is something I love about ND products that I love.  They take quite a few uses before they start showing wear.  They are expensive, but to me the value is there. 

And yes!  Pan what excites you regardless of age.I have a gorgeous deep dark blue nail Polish with silver sparkly bits, from Maybelline, called Blue Freeze. It's my current favourite and looks best with more than 1 layer. The sparkly bits show up better.Also, I want a home your!I know you are studying! I hope your exam goes well!I only have 2 cream products an eye shadow and a blush. I have yet to "pan" either one of them! Good job Steph!🥳🎉💝💝💝About panning the ND blush palette, maybe try to just hit pan in every shade in it, that will take long enough and then play with other things :)well done! that catrice nail polish is so pretty I need to see if they have any catrice polishes here!Good luck on your exams!!!  Those new nail polishes are so pretty!  I can’t to see what they look like on, especially the glitter.You are doing well. I've hardly worn makeup lately so I'm not getting anywhere with my panning right now.I'm amazed by the Natasha Denona cream blush! It's never-ending!! I've been thinking about picking it up, but hoping to eventually be able to swatch it in store. Would you recommend it? Great update as always :)I think you should work on the ND palette I’m thinking about using it next year myself ... it’s a beautiful palette and sometimes we just use old  things that don’t bring us joy and I think it’s great to balance them out ❤️✨The lighting on this video was very nice. Whatever camera settings and lighting you used you should do all the time.Definitely pan things that you love.... yes there are older things in a collection but if you love something what is the point of letting it get old and then panning it?  I say do a mix of new and old - so you dont feel bad about neglecting old products but you also use new things while you are obsessed with them.As a fellow clumsy nail person, have you tried a clean up brush? I just keep one of those, some NP remover, and a flat cotton pad nearby when I'm putting the color portion on my nail and clean up as I go - and they always look great!I realized while filming this was my last update before finale too lol wow so many pretty nail polishes!! Theyll be perfect for this time 💖SAY SOME PRAYERS FOR MY EXAMS NOW GUYS! You’re not my mom, you can’t tell me what to do 😝. What color broke of your polishes? Hopefully it’s one you had already used and wasn’t a massive fan of. I think that ND palette would take years to finish.... I think you should savor it and use it whenever you want, so if that means panning it, fine but then you wouldn’t really use anything else 🤔.Super excited to jump in on this project again in 2021!  ❤️Nice to see you having fun with your newer items❤ I plan to join the project pan in Jan.I totally know what you mean about highlighting and texture! I had no idea my skin had that much weirdness on it until I slapped a highlighter on. Wow!!😳 Good luck on your exam, love!!!!!! I'm on your shoulder!😘😘😘You choose pretty products!  ❤️👍🏽Hi Steph i agree with Rayan, just enjoy ur NDPalette, it looks gorgeous, that electric blue nail polish was fab, i dont own navy nail polish but i might do soon after i see it on you! Ps ur intro's are sooo personable so never feel awkward, mite join u in January and try to pan more stuff, still sendin good vibes re exam on thur', big hugs to ya  ❤,  ps "Get subscribin to Stephs channel people!!!!!"I think u should pan an old pallete next year , the ND pallete makes u happy so just use it and enjoy ithow many pencil eye liners do you have from UD?  you're doing amazing and yay to that iconic liquid highlighter.  i know it's not technically "finished" yet but at least you're not constantly looking at it to use it.  it will just finish up quickly in your lotion.Great update 😊 you are doing an amazing job on all of your projects. I think I will join this next year to ☺️I can’t believe how many uses you have got for that lip scrub!You are beyond awesome as a panner, Dannie! Seriously, you are the BEST panner I know.

Pannnnnnn!Loving the old hollywood glam with your hair and red lip combo 😍 absolutely beautiful SofieEyeshadow primer is almost impossible to finish.. :/I love your hair in this. And yes! It's so hard to wear lipstick these days. I tend to reach for lipliner and lipbalm instead. If anything, masks are the perfect opportunity to show off great shadow.Love your makeup ! Great updateSofie your hair is looking amazing!  Great update!! I have full faith you'll hit the mark on your super shockThe curly hair is very pretty!  I’m excited to see your finale next month.

So beautiful!I'm curious to see hat eye primer you pick up next. I think I eventually want to try the P Louise one.The Mac paint pot is one of my favourites eyeshadow primers and the sigma one is also amazing!Try the Milani eyeshadow primer :) Emily Noel and I love it 😍Your curls look so beautiful!Oooo, yay! New room! Home! :D Hopefully the unpacking and settling in is going well. :)I will be sad to see you go, but I do remember in the beginning you saying that you didn’t know how long you were going to be in this project because you didn’t have that many cream productsI totally understand not joining again! That's a good thing even though I will miss you in this project!I am in love with you channel , I can say so far that you are talented and you love doing videos. I am so happy when I see people as genuine as you 🙂!! we also create video and i would love if you could check them ❤️I like your new setting. Also, your makeup look today is beautiful. 🤗You're doing so well!! Oooo.... Getting PIE done, i think it's going to be close. :) I think you can do it though. Oooo... that NYX butter gloss looks gorgeous. :O I've not heard of that one.... Now I want it. Oh well. lol. Add it to the wishlist.I am so excited to see the update on the roll-ins too!Yes!!! I am waiting to see them apples!!!Love the green eyeshadow!!!Your eye look is beautiful today 😍You are so close to finishing The Balm Palette!!  Super exciting!! 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼You can definitely finish Pie! It is going to be so great when you’ve finished that entire palette! 
I’m joining in this project next year; I’m looking forward to it!I think I want to join this project next year I may have to be more organized but I think I can do it. I think you can finish the lip gloss and the blush that would be so satisfying for you! I am trying really hard to finish up a nars lip crayon this year so I can add another lip empty to my numbers.I’ve struggled with panning lipstick this year too. I do ok with glosses and lacquers.For your GRWM - do the deserted island question from The Office! What are your deserted island movies?I am cracking up at how loud the puppies are!I do a little dance every time you say “thank you for coming back to check out another video” because you say it the same way each time. 😂 I love it!The nyx butter glosses are definitely doable within a month! Good luck!U have very good progress , i love this project it just a reminder to use creams🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝
I love how your pen is attached to your sweater 🤣

If I didn’t loose something in my project pan, I am almost surprised 🤣You should get a silicon spatula for your cream products when they’re almost empty. I think ulta sells a set for cheapGreat progress as always! I am excited to see what you finish for the finale!Awww I love that eyeshadow. Use it.🥳🎉🌻You can pull the stopper on that foundation if you want! Makes it a bit easier to use the last bit - just because I know you like it so much!Quick question about your physicians formula foundation... So mine says that it expires this month, but I've only been using it for 5 months and Im hoping to finish it up here in the next few months but its slow going, how far away from the expiration date did you use yours? And have you noticed any formula changes? The only reason why Im thinking it has that set date is cuz of the spf, but other than that i havent really seen any complications from using it.Yay a new update! Totally get your pain on the lipsticks.. looking forward to next update n the year Long update too:)! stay safe during the storm!I’m so hyped to see that colourpop highlight to be gone lolYay sounds like next update will be exciting! :) take care especially with the storm raging 💕Great update. I hope you are safe 💜🙂 I love your makeup today 🙂 I'm sure you didn't but my mom and I totally missed the story time on Sunday 😥. I know it's probably just more work for you though lol.I love your look today!As soon as the video started I noticed how good this eye look and hair style makes your eyes look! They really pop and make you look fresh and healthy :)Love your eye look! stay safe <3I vote lipstick all over the faceThis eye look is so beautiful! 💜🌻Love the eye look. Good luck with the storm. ⛈That eyeshadow 😍Purple eyeshadow looks great on you 💜You are even sweater than cream Christina, Happy Monday🤩❤💚✨xx!You're so so beautiful! I didn't want this video to end hahaYouve done so well with this project!I kinda wanna do this project next year! I don’t know what the rules are and I only post on Instagram now but this project looks like fun!Plenty to consider a success! I hope you update us in the finale with how many items you tried, kept, and decluttered!I'm so glad you are going to participate again next year! Yay!I think your eyes look gorgeous. Have fun panning momma.Congrats on your pregnancy 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰" it should be here until the end of time" haha. I totally understand 4 products🧡I'm using up my OG Naked Skin foundation and concealers. I'm sad, but I'm doing it. I'm testing some new concealers to replace them (Elf, CP), but finding a shade is tough!Your eye look is so pretty here :) thank you - your videos give me so much inspo when I play with colours!The cream products that I’m panning are still going strong and refuse to be used up!  They are staying as part of my makeup basket for when I wear makeup.  Aww, you got a puppy?!  Yay!!!!Ooooh...puppy....kisses to the puppy. Don't you just love it when that baby pan just sneaks up on you? It's the best...pat on the back followed by crazed hysterics which bring the husband, the children and any animals running.Love💕💕Nice progress!And that’s why this is a great project because creme products go bad faster.you are doing well! i hate when cream products go bad but it happens!I love that you say "Hola Familia" at the beggining of every video! Im a latina too. Saludos desde Guatemala 🇬🇹❣Congrats on pan. What shadow are you wearing? Its gorgeousI hardly ever use up anything. I either give it to my daughter or just throw it out.It's so tragic when cream products go bad, you can literally smell something is off... or the product will give you acne. 0.o Oh, I panned a lipgloss yesterday! So I'm attacking a mini dark plum lipstick and using more shimmery green lipsticks (I adore Hydro from Sugarpill, tastes like candy and orange). I'm wearing the weirdest colors while going to do job interviews, nobody is going to see the weirdness anyway with a facemask. Eh eh I've got a secret XDHi Alex, I think my lippies have gone bad lol, so many ahhhYour day sounds like mine. Crazy mum life! You’re killing it with all your projects. ❤️Great update Alex! I definitely think that Mac item can be done by next month!It'll be here until the end of time. 😂😂😂Gotta love a surprise pan woohoo 👏🏼👏🏼 killin it girl 💖Today I finished a lipgloss that I’ve been working on for the entire year and it feels so good ! So I get what you say about the KVD one ! It has been used ... if it’s time to go then bye ! 🥰😌 great progress Ale ! Kisses to LeoGreat update!:) any chance of puppy vlog GRWM style? 😬😬😁😁😍Yayyy the first one to click and watch , love your videos ❤️❤️😘 , was waiting for your one , 
Keep up the  good work girl ,
Love u😘😘I love how dedicated you are to making products work for you, Paula! That makes you an awesome panner in my book! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaYour a great project panner,  ya goof. 😁My cream products just absolutely refuse to be finished and some are outstaying their welcome!  Lol!Great progress!!Can't wait for your inventory next year!! I think you did a very good job in 2020 (despite everything going on) and the most exciting update here was the cp highlighter - that is hard to pan! Great progress as always 👏👏🌺Nice update Paula! ❤️Maybe you can roll in the Mousse Bronzer from Laura Gellar for next update, it might be a better shade for you during winter. Plus it will dry out soon and I don’t know if it’s possible to revive mousse products.As well as mixing some of the cream into the dark bronzer, add some green too. It will help to neutralise the red pigment better than the cream alone, bringing the intensity down. It will still be your preferred red toned bronzer but you won't get orange coming through.Hi me again, just wondering... is it Amber's fault you want that CT illuminating beautiful thing? Just cos it is her fault that I want it lololol OK... I promise no more comments from me on the same video! Over and out...And for the record... you are not 'a horrible project panner' .... you are the best project panner ❤Enjoy that green corrector... I've used mine up now and have no others to use and now realise I quite liked it... so be nice and kind to your green concealer, talk to it, let it know it is special and loved lol xxxLove that idea of mixing the dark and light concealers together!  Nice 'Get R done' kind of attitude.  LOL!!I reckon you could even use ur laura geller mousse bronzer to mix with that dark concealer shade. Otherwise that mousse might become stone before you get to use it.Is there a story behind why you bought that dark elf concealer kit?So excited you uploaded! The end of the year always makes me so sad because all these fun projects are ending at once pretty much.You're making fantastic progress, I'm really looking forward to your next inventory! What do you think you'll  do after you finish lunch money, focus more on other liquid illuminators, or grab a different cream highlighter?

I have a green correcting stick by elf I should probably use but it's SO pigmented to the point where I don't even think it's usable in that way. And I'm not sure a green eye base is a good idea 😂😂😂Hold you use the darkest brown as a brow shade? To fill in your browsHow are you finding panning the creams? hahaIm def participating in 2021!I have the exact same problem with highlighters and the best way to overcome it is apply highlighter first (even before bronzer to make it even more seamless) I saw DaLin also talk about her doing the same thing too! It's definitely a technique I also discovered last yeyar!That highlighter really lasts! And that blush... 😅 That palette looks so nice - you should pan it if you feel like it. Have the same problem with my scale, only shows full grams, should buy a new one too. That blue Nail polishens looks so nice. Hope you like them (my Ciate minis was good at first but the second half was not, maybe they were old). Good luck with your exams - maybe you are already done 😊You are good and the green nail polish was beautiful :) I am also bad at painting my nails at the moment: / (and I am a nail designer). Sorry I have not seen all your videos lately or commented, I have been packing I have bought an apartment :) Moving in November 17th :) I will be more active again when I have moved into the new apartment) Many hugs from Ida (in Norway)You've got some beautiful products in! :) That Huda cream is moving along slowly! Also, the ND palette is expensive. If you want to pan it, pan it. Get your money's worth out of it. :)That Catrice shade is definitely a me shade! lol  How rude that a polish dared to break in transit!! Dang 73 uses and it is still kicking.  I'd just enjoy that ND face palette awhile before you try to pan it.  Sometimes I start to get sick of things I pan so I don't like to subject loved products to that resentment.  lolI think if you're enjoying that ND blush palette so much that you should pan it next year if you want! 🙌 Remember, we're panning things we love and want to in 2021. 😉You are such a great panner, Steph. I love watching your updates. I am so glad y'all are bringing this project back for the new yr. It's definite;y a good one. Prayers for your exams! Love you, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI know what you mean. I was thinking about panning my Jackie Aina palette for 2021, because I know I will really enjoy it. Then I think I should pick something older like a Kat Von D palette,  but I know I wont like it as muchThat is something I love about ND products that I love.  They take quite a few uses before they start showing wear.  They are expensive, but to me the value is there. 

And yes!  Pan what excites you regardless of age.I have a gorgeous deep dark blue nail Polish with silver sparkly bits, from Maybelline, called Blue Freeze. It's my current favourite and looks best with more than 1 layer. The sparkly bits show up better.Also, I want a home your!I know you are studying! I hope your exam goes well!I only have 2 cream products an eye shadow and a blush. I have yet to "pan" either one of them! Good job Steph!🥳🎉💝💝💝About panning the ND blush palette, maybe try to just hit pan in every shade in it, that will take long enough and then play with other things :)well done! that catrice nail polish is so pretty I need to see if they have any catrice polishes here!Good luck on your exams!!!  Those new nail polishes are so pretty!  I can’t to see what they look like on, especially the glitter.You are doing well. I've hardly worn makeup lately so I'm not getting anywhere with my panning right now.I'm amazed by the Natasha Denona cream blush! It's never-ending!! I've been thinking about picking it up, but hoping to eventually be able to swatch it in store. Would you recommend it? Great update as always :)I think you should work on the ND palette I’m thinking about using it next year myself ... it’s a beautiful palette and sometimes we just use old  things that don’t bring us joy and I think it’s great to balance them out ❤️✨The lighting on this video was very nice. Whatever camera settings and lighting you used you should do all the time.Definitely pan things that you love.... yes there are older things in a collection but if you love something what is the point of letting it get old and then panning it?  I say do a mix of new and old - so you dont feel bad about neglecting old products but you also use new things while you are obsessed with them.As a fellow clumsy nail person, have you tried a clean up brush? I just keep one of those, some NP remover, and a flat cotton pad nearby when I'm putting the color portion on my nail and clean up as I go - and they always look great!I realized while filming this was my last update before finale too lol wow so many pretty nail polishes!! Theyll be perfect for this time 💖SAY SOME PRAYERS FOR MY EXAMS NOW GUYS! You’re not my mom, you can’t tell me what to do 😝. What color broke of your polishes? Hopefully it’s one you had already used and wasn’t a massive fan of. I think that ND palette would take years to finish.... I think you should savor it and use it whenever you want, so if that means panning it, fine but then you wouldn’t really use anything else 🤔.Super excited to jump in on this project again in 2021!  ❤️Nice to see you having fun with your newer items❤ I plan to join the project pan in Jan.I totally know what you mean about highlighting and texture! I had no idea my skin had that much weirdness on it until I slapped a highlighter on. Wow!!😳 Good luck on your exam, love!!!!!! I'm on your shoulder!😘😘😘You choose pretty products!  ❤️👍🏽Hi Steph i agree with Rayan, just enjoy ur NDPalette, it looks gorgeous, that electric blue nail polish was fab, i dont own navy nail polish but i might do soon after i see it on you! Ps ur intro's are sooo personable so never feel awkward, mite join u in January and try to pan more stuff, still sendin good vibes re exam on thur', big hugs to ya  ❤,  ps "Get subscribin to Stephs channel people!!!!!"I think u should pan an old pallete next year , the ND pallete makes u happy so just use it and enjoy itI dont mind how short this update was. No need to drag it out!I love your updates whether they be short or long. Lol! I never knew Flower Beauty made perfumes? I guess I missed that train. Lol! Stay safe, Gorgeous! TFS! ~ NonaI had to Google Australian Gold sunscreen because I'd never heard of it. I'm in my 40s and am Australian.  Turns out it's founded by an Indiana man who has an Aussie mum.
PS - Aussie brand haircare in the purple packaging is also not AustralianThat's actually really impressive progress on the Colourpop lip! 😍I feel the same way about that Australian gold sunscreen! It's a little thicc. 😅I have a mini of that SPF and you are right, it's better for the summer months.very sucessful project!still great progress! always love your updates :)You could always mix the Australian Gold with a greasy sunscreen.  I have one that I just purchased that doesn’t dry down, so I would mix it with an Australian Gold type sunscreen if I had it.  I am using it up on my hands & neck.Sending you positive panning vibes!! I need a new sunscreen any favorites?Maybe you’ll finish them all 🤍❤️ what’s your favorite sunscreen for oily skin ? Would love to knowI personally really appreciate that you didn’t try to make this video longer than it should! I love quick and snappy videos where you show the progress you’ve made 🤗💛Oh yes those Flower Beauty perfumes!! At one point I had owned/sampled almost all of them, and I stocked up on the red one (Narcissus Fatale) when there was a sale on last year. 🌹  I do wonder if it was a strategic decision, as Drew Barrymore launched her talk show and then did that reveal last month of Flower Beauty rolling out across 3000 CVS stores... and a lot of people probably don't immediately think of CVS for perfumes. 🤷‍♀️They can all be finishedNo matter the length I always enjoy your project pans so much :) Especially with so many sales coming up during the festive months, it's always good to keep our purchases in check <3I was ready to settle on my couch and watch your video but it was too short to do that! Please do a chatty grwm or something along those lines before the end of the year? I really enjoy your companyI believe it's pronounced da  and not "day" lin. 💜What a surprise ! Well done with this foundation ! Even though you mixed it, that was a lot to use up in a month I'm impressed ! I don't even do that kind of progress without mixing mine lolCongrats about finishing that foundation!! I am planning to join in on this project in January and can’t wait. I’ve watched everyone over the past year and I think it seems like such a fun project!!Off topic, but your necklances are so pretty - where are they from?Yayayayay! Way to go with that foundation! Wow!Random video idea. Products you hated enough to declutter instead of panning. For me it would be the NYX liquid liner.That becca foundation is a cakey mess. I got mine at tjmaxx for $10 and I'd still never buy it again.Thanks for the info, a good goal for me next year!  After doing a general Project Pan this year, having more specific goals would be great!So happy for you that the foundation is done. It's great to make something work but it feels like such an effort when you know you've got products that don't need mixing up like a scientist.Great job finishing up the Becca foundation!  It’s such an amazing feeling to finish up an item that you don’t like.Love this eye look!Yay on the Becca foundation! I know it’s been here for a minute, lolI received the Becca foundation too. It’s so heavy, way to go on finishing it.Whoa good job on that Becca foundation!! I want to finish two by the end of the year so I’m hoping I can!! What would you say the cp pretty fresh concealer coverage is?I got a sample sachet of three colours of that Becca foundation in a Sephora order. I wore it twice, hated it!! I thought of you both times I wore it. You did very very well finishing it up🙌I love how short and to-the-point your videos are! Great progress! Congrats on finishing that Becca foundation 🥳You're doing well! I'm almost sorry I couldn't do updates this month. I just needed the break after my dog passed and I think I may have to put on some makeup today.Hey, I'm a girly tomboy too ! lol Great update !I love this eye look!!! 💜💜💜Tell me why I have never heard the term "girly tomboy." That is me too!!! Love it and the update!!!I love your eye look, Jess! Super pretty! All progress is good progress! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGood progress with that eyeliner! Hope the brow thing is empty soon 😅 I had a brow gel that did that exact same thing and I gave up on that. I thought it was old and that was why it balled up - but I am not sure. It was a mini. Anyway, a pain to work with...Your eye look is so pretty!  My cream products are sadder than yours.  They just refuse to be finished but I’m forging on with them as part of my regular makeup basket.this eye look is gorgeous!!Keep at it. You never know what might actually magically dry up and be finished in time. 😁🤪You look great in purple!Omg. I am so loving this eyelook. You rock purples so well. 

I think with this year being so crazy we just have to take the little makeup victories as they come. I think you've done well with everything. 🎉

Edit to say that I feel you so much about brow struggles. 😅Whoa look at that jump on piggy liner! 👏🏼👏🏼 We’re on the last stretch! We got this!!Beautiful eye look today, Jessica 😍It's the time of year when we're trying to wrap up all the projects, so there is always a lot of products to focus on at the same time. You did well, especially with Piggy Bank, I'm really impressed! Can't believe the finale is coming up next month, but I'm excited to refresh it for next year :)I love how you coordinates your eyeshadows with your sweater. Very pretty!love the eye look!Love your eyeshadow!  It just pops with your sweater!It is hard to make amazing progress on a liquid and cream blush at the same time.  It was smart to prioritize one.  Such great progress on the re-homed cream bronzer.I keep seeing this Cover FX get full then empty the next update lol Great update as always ! I think that one day I will buy the Nars blushThis update was amazing progress. The cover fx update was exciting😲The progress is the cover fx palette is awesome! Well done!👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Amazing progress!Wow! Waiting on a job for 2 months is a lot! I hope that you get it!!!If Steph got hired at Disney for her singing, I would die with happiness 🤣🤣🤣Well good Lord😲 you've made so much progress everywhere. Its nice to get to use a brand new product. Im going to guess 20 uses haha im probably way off.Omg best of luck on your 2nd interview. They are so stressful and time consuming process. I hope you get an offer that makes you happy.You are such a joyful, beautiful human being😭🧡Great progress all around Fey!!!!I am so impressed that you finished the hair oil! I've never mentioned it to you, but I used to have one. I had to give it away because my hair was too thin. Although, I never tried it as a mask. Either way, I know it is tough to pan!Progress is progress girl! That usage on the white foundation is pretty impressive! Your makeup is very pretty!WOW that glow ball is a LOT of product. You should be happy with your progress on all of your products.You can def. see progress in that highlight!!!There is so much product in the domed glow ball!  I can tell that you’ve been working on it. I’ve been looking into getting a white foundation adjuster. Do you like the one that you’re using?You should get a silicon spatula for your cream products when they’re almost empty. I think ulta sells a set for cheapGreat progress as always! I am excited to see what you finish for the finale!Awww I love that eyeshadow. Use it.🥳🎉🌻You can pull the stopper on that foundation if you want! Makes it a bit easier to use the last bit - just because I know you like it so much!Quick question about your physicians formula foundation... So mine says that it expires this month, but I've only been using it for 5 months and Im hoping to finish it up here in the next few months but its slow going, how far away from the expiration date did you use yours? And have you noticed any formula changes? The only reason why Im thinking it has that set date is cuz of the spf, but other than that i havent really seen any complications from using it.Yay a new update! Totally get your pain on the lipsticks.. looking forward to next update n the year Long update too:)! stay safe during the storm!I’m so hyped to see that colourpop highlight to be gone lolYay sounds like next update will be exciting! :) take care especially with the storm raging 💕Great update.

Good luck with the storm. ⛈That eyeshadow 😍Purple eyeshadow looks great on you 💜You are even sweater than cream Christina, Happy Monday🤩❤💚✨xx!You're so so beautiful! I didn't want this video to end hahaYaay congrats on the empty! I hate using tweezers too since I either cut myself or ruin a tweezer 😆Is it wrong of me to say that I don’t use tweezers? I bought my own pair of pliers for it 🤣🤣🤣Hooray for an empty!  Do find that the ELF pore primer makes you oily?  I've wanted to try it but I have super oily skin.  OMG I loved ELF Ain't That Sweet.  I really miss it.  Great update!👍👍👍Awesome progress! I think I forget something every single time I do an update!

I hope you love the tatcha moisturizer so much that you can't put it down 😉Use your Hubby's needle-nosed pliers to take out stoppers instead of your tweezers. Lol! That's what I do. Good progress, Beth! Glad you are going to continue this project in the new yr. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaNice job!Keep up the good work ☺️🤩I’m here to watch while I cook dinner ☺️I’m gonna go get the Elf puddy primer. I hope it works for me. Thank you so much for sharing my beautiful friend.👍how many pencil eye liners do you have from UD?  you're doing amazing and yay to that iconic liquid highlighter.  i know it's not technically "finished" yet but at least you're not constantly looking at it to use it.  it will just finish up quickly in your lotion.Great update 😊 you are doing an amazing job on all of your projects. I think I will join this next year to ☺️I can’t believe how many uses you have got for that lip scrub!You are beyond awesome as a panner, Dannie! Seriously, you are the BEST panner I know.

Either way, I know it is tough to pan!I am rooting for you to finish that lipstick!! I would never be able to, but you are soooo much better with lip products than I am!Those eyeliner shades are very pretty!!

Your makeup is very pretty!WOW that glow ball is a LOT of product. You should be happy with your progress on all of your products.You can def. see progress in that highlight!!!There is so much product in the domed glow ball!

I’m joining in this project next year; I’m looking forward to it!I think I want to join this project next year I may have to be more organized but I think I can do it. I think you can finish the lip gloss and the blush that would be so satisfying for you! I am trying really hard to finish up a nars lip crayon this year so I can add another lip empty to my numbers.I’ve struggled with panning lipstick this year too. I do ok with glosses and lacquers.For your GRWM - do the deserted island question from The Office! What are your deserted island movies?I am cracking up at how loud the puppies are!I do a little dance every time you say “thank you for coming back to check out another video” because you say it the same way each time. 😂 I love it!The nyx butter glosses are definitely doable within a month! Good luck!U have very good progress , i love this project it just a reminder to use creams🎉🎉🎉💝💝💝
I love how your pen is attached to your sweater 🤣

If I didn’t loose something in my project pan, I am almost surprised 🤣It is hard to make amazing progress on a liquid and cream blush at the same time.  It was smart to prioritize one.  Such great progress on the re-homed cream bronzer.I keep seeing this Cover FX get full then empty the next update lol Great update as always ! I think that one day I will buy the Nars blushThis update was amazing progress. The cover fx update was exciting😲The progress is the cover fx palette is awesome! Well done!👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Amazing progress!Hey guys, how are you getting on with your projects? We are sooo close to the end of the year! It's crazy...You made really really good progress. 👏😲First off, I adore your robe!! Secondly, I have never heard of anyone using a lip gloss with their nail polish. I am so intrigued. 
I just found your channel and subbed.  Best of luck in the finale!PANNNN!That glitter is sooo satisfying! I love seeing all that progress!Never tried the Mac paint pots but I’ve heard good things 😍I loveeee when blushes build slowly 🙌🏻Szanny Side is the best!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️These are such fun projects to watch! I may join in for the new year...I have LOTS of makeup and could definitely use more of some of it lolWhat a great finale Katariina!!! Thank you so much for panning with us!!!That elf bronzer palette has awesome progress!!!! Yay!!!!!I completely understand lipstick panning fatigue! In the future, I want to only pan lipsticks that are almost done! It get exhausting panning the same thing forever!I'm really interested in trying this project. Your progress is really impressive. I'm relatively new at panning and I always try to put in a lip product but I have yet to finish one. I get sick of them or resent using them after a while! I think I might join this project in 2021, but probably put a usage goal in place incase I decide an item isn't worth panning.🥳🎉💝Good job finishing 2 pans in the Elf contour palette. Nice finale, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaGreat job finishing off two pans in the ELF contour palette!  🎉🎉 I completely understand why you’re ending this project. I enjoyed following your progress in this project.It makes sense to do the finale if you don't have a lot of cream products in your collection.U ARE SO PRETTY! You did a great job! Really enjoyed watching! Cant wait to see more from you!😍 Rang the bell and joined U❤❤❤❤😆help me out with picking products for next round! im so stumped! I cant make a decision for any project next year!That last bit is so close to done I can get behind the "calling it good" and ditching itFriend, you are very beautiful. Will you befriend me?...I love the color of your lipstick but i don't know for some reason it doesn't look good on my lips.  Awesome reviews.Loved the update Kailee!That lipstick is beautiful!I love that you already picked out next year's items!!!Hello vampy lips! 😍 The shade looks amazing on you!

That is super satisfying to see the empty MAC Paint Pot! 🙌Progress is progress! I would be awful at this. Luckily I like to declutter and I get bored easily so I don't have much that overstays its welcome. Full support, keep in touch!You look gorgeous, Kailee! It was so super satisfying to see that paint pot wiped clean. Lol! Awesome stuff right there! Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI’m already starting to plan next year’s projects too 😄🙈Bahaha " duh, that's the finale" 😅😅🎊💜🎊 FIRSTI enjoyed your update Lori!

I appreciated your review of the liquid shadow. I love that you have tough products in here and have made a lot A LOT of progress.I've been binge watching your videos for literally 4 hours now! love them so much !!!!!! found your channel yesterday and I just love your vibe and am excited for new videos. subscribed immediately :)Paige Koren made a video of her sephora haul in 2019 whether she's still using the products ect. would be nice if you do too! ☺️AwwWhat if you put that green shadow over the green in the prism palette, or over a I don’t know any other green 😆😍😍😍😍  How are you and the family doing?I’m so obsessed with these videos😍Great progress.  Do you have brands that are in your no thank you November?Such a bummer that green shadow isn't great. It looks so promising, but I'm glad for the honest review!This video just motivated me to redo my eyeshadow look.  I am now wearing two cream eyeshadow sticks & an eye liner.  All three products have been neglected in my collection.you are doing well! liquid blush and cream blush are so hard to finish!🥳🎉💝💝💝your composure with that spider is unbelievable. I would have freaked out! lol ALSO! congrats on the progress! hahahYou have been doing well on these products. I’m planning to join this project next year because I definitely need to use up my cream products.Video hasn’t even started and I wanted to tell you that I really like your makeup look today.I use eye drops to rehydrate my Stila Glitter and Glows. I've rehydrated mine like that a few times, and they work perfectly. Definitely call that Balm product done. She's dry as the saharan.You are doing great using up products. I'm terrible at using up anything. I was just sitting here thinking about you and your video showed up, yea! Hope you are having an amazing week!"This is my brain on 2020..." bwah hah hah ha!!!!!

Starts January 10? I'm in! So many projects start on the 1st I won't be starting them till probably February with all the other videos I want to do firstYeah, that shadow stick does not look purple!  Lol!  Glad to see this project is coming back!  It’s  nice to focus on the cream products that can go bad sooner.  I have a huge cream empty, a big 16 oz tub of Skinn body butter.  A little section of space back in the cabinet!  I constantly use body lotion/cream so this is an easy product for me.  I have more in the cabinet though... lol!I forgot to mention how many I used up this year woops lol great job 👏🏼👏🏼If you really dislike a product would you ever declutter?you did great with this project!I so enjoyed following you along the whole year during this and I'm so happy you'll be doing in next year! 🎉 I think that you did so amazing for the whole year.Cream products are so difficult! You’ve done so well!It's not often that you are negative about a product and struggle to make it work so it must be atrocious. I think you did a great job on this project. Cream products always take longer than we expect. Tricksy things!5 finished products for the year is great! Thanks so much for panning with us!Love the Christmas nails!I am so glad this project is coming back next yr. I love watching y'all's updates. It really makes me wanna use my cream products more. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHi Jessica : first! I m going into this project next year... What the difference between an eye base and a primer please? Under creamy eyes product? Sorry, I m not good with those products... Stay safe I m going to check if something is dry after you said...i know you're not big on lip scrubs but i am surprised you didn't finish.  however, it's a good product to have - you def get your money's worth and i'm sure you will finish it by the end of the year/beginning of next year.  i bought the IT superhero liner based off of you adding it into this project and raving about it.  it is really good!  i just find my control for my cat eye isn't as good as with a pot liner but that's just me and learning to use it.  congrats on all of your progress in this project this year!  you have done so well over all with all of your projects!  you da panning queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!Congrats, that's really awesome!OMG COMMITMENT! Your eyelook is Gorgeous!❤Omg you have finished so many things! Good work 👏🏻🥳🥰 Next year Iam going to join to ☺️❤️You did so well both in the finale but also throughout the whole project! Looking forward to doing this with you and everyone else again next year :) xThank you so much for panning with us this year!20 out of 22 is insane!! Awesome job Dannie!You did great!!!Dang I am still using my It Cosmetics eyeliner and I have been using it for probably the last 3-4 months. I only do my makeup like 4 times a week though 🤷‍♀️ Anyways, you did sooo great, as always!! ❤️❤️great progressI love that this project was your first video on you channel.  You did extremely well with this project. Looking forward to seeing what you pick for the January reboot!Awe. What a milestone. You've come full circle! 🎉

You killed this project whether you finish the last 2 products or not. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaHi would you repurchase any of these products?Well done👍🏼👍🏼Great work!  I’m so happy you started your channel.How is this lip scrub not done ?! 🤯 And 7 batches for the highlighter, I thought you mixed more of it in your body lotions. I did anyway and maybe that's why I didn't like it lolYou did so well! 🎉Thank you EVERYONE for participating and/or following along. Please don't forget to fill this in by the 15th please :) https://forms.gle/3ikfG9kHBs5oqSgA8You did so well!! I am so excited to see what you put in next year!!Thank you so much Steph!!!

I’ve signed up for next year to do it on insta & am excited to be a part of it!Hello Steph! Congratulations on your finale! The results are so satisfying! 
I have a question, does nail polish count for this project??? Or only face makeup???
Thanks 💕I love this project so much! 😍 I follow so many people who joined in! 🥰 I myself would love to join in next year!Yay! We get to watch again next year!❤hey steph, i want to have your permission to do skincare edition as I am not a makeup person and have those numbers in control, i would love to get some skincare doneThis was the most exciting project ever! You & DaLin are awesome to have come up with it. Great job, Gorgeous! I can't wait to watch everyone's intros in 2021! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThis is one of the best projects ever.  You did amazing on this project!  I loved all of the ColourPop swatches.  I can't get enough of the super shock shadows."they aren't the same at all... But they are similar" 🤣 me justifying my makeup and nail polish purchasesI'm joining in for 2021. ^_^ Can't wait! You did well this year!Congrats on this project👍🏼🎉Wonderful job!   I will be doing this project next yearyou two created an amazing project pan and i am excited to do it again!! you also did so well!!Thanks to you for creating this. 

I loved it, I focused it on non make up items because one of my goals for 2020 was to included as many make up as I could in the project and so far I had to much going on. Next year I may be more challenging for me picking uo product that may stoy all year, but I don't mind, they ones I am thinking of are long term products anyway and for that reason are very neglected. If I want I can do a refresh so I think is pretty ok. 

Ah, I also prefer having tiem after projects to just not worry about usage so I tipically end or start my year long project before or after, I normally do a PTP from middle Jan to mid Dec, and I have time to enjoy other things.

HughesEvery time you show the jelly shadows I drool a little. They're just so yummy when you swatch them. See you for next year where we will both be driven insane by Colour Tattoos again. I've got a ton more too 😢You did amazing, and again thank you thank you thank you for starting this project with DaLin! Can't wait to join again next year 😊Well done Steph! This project was amazing and I’m so glad it got such great support from other panners!

Thank you so much for joining in this year!! I am so excited for the second round!I am so excited to hear how you like the p louise base!!!I love the makeup look! The lashes are super cute!congrats on finishing the benetint and everything else!! You made me want to pan mine next year (or try lol)Wow amazing job. You did so good considering where lip products has been so hard this year.How is your make up always so beautiful?!This finale is great! Good job! And congratulations on finishing the Benetint! 🥳👏🏻❤️Your eye look is so pretty!  I love your nail polish as well.  Great job finishing the Benetint! 🎉🎉 You did so well with this project.Thank you so much Sofie. You did so so well. You finished reeeally hard products 👏👏Wow ! Great finaleThumbs down for the owner of PLouis.YAY!!!  You finished the Benetint!!!!  What a great finale to have a bunch of empties and goals met!the most gorgeous girl on planetI would count the lipgloss as an empty.I would consider it half a product, for the KVD lipstickCount the gloss as a half product, and adv half it’s value in your empty $ total. You did great!Even though I’m late to the game, I say count the KVD lip gloss as a deluxe sample because you did use that much product.  For cream products, I recently finished a 16 oz tub of body cream.  Not too hard to do at this time of the year!  And also a hair conditioner that has been lingering in the cabinet.  These are bulky items so it’s nice to have some space back.  It doesn’t look like any of my cream makeup products will be finished this year.  I will continue using them though because I want these finished.Girl! You worked hard on that stinky lip gloss! I would definitely tally it! :-)Count it! That’s more gloss I’ve EVER used lolRe the lipgloss, I'd consider it empty.  You used it as much as you could. Cest la vie. Live the Gene Wilder insert too xWell dine😊Loving the time stamps in recent videos 👌👌👌OMG Alex, your eyes! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 so beautiful!!! Awesome progress this year! I can’t wait to do. Again next year! ❤️I almost finished another liquid lipstick from Sugarpill and a mini lipstick from KIKO, I wonder if I'll be able to pan them by the end of the year! 0.oThank you so much Alex ❤ i am so grateful. I would count the kvd as half monetary value in your empties because you used half the value. It all counts 😂❤loook at the pan.You did great throughout this project, and I'm happy to hear you're doing this again next year too! I would say count the lipgloss as an empty! You used up as much as you could have, and worked on it for so long. I think it's only fair to get the reward of counting it in your empties 😊Oh my goodness! That beautiful empty pan! Wow! You did so well with this project! Thank you so much for panning with us this year! I am already looking forward to next year's round 2!I'd definitely count that lipgloss in your emptiesYou did amazing job and I agree with the comments on here count it as half because you’re halfway finished with it so it should count.💕💕I would count the lip glossCount that gloss girl!! 🥳 you used more than whats left.Love your eye look 😍Definitely count the gloss!!❤️❤️Hi. I'm new 2 your channel & was wondering if I could create U a full face look 2 do on video soon?? If interested let me know your top 3 most used brands as well as your hair color & eye color then I will get creating & get back w/U.You used half. Count that! It's deserved. We'll done.Awesome project Ale ! ❤️❤️❤️Wow you’ve done so well! I say count the kid lippie as deluxe! You did use up half so why not! ☺️👏🏼👏🏼I would count the lip product especially since you did use it!Alex, I love the empties, I'm still emptying my foundationGive yourself half credit for the gloss!!! Absolutely 😊However you count the gloss it’s still a success!👍👍Count as half- the way I see it, if the item was good for another six months, you would likely have finished it, therefore you should count the amount you got through before it went bad.  If it was something you would likely have decluttered or never finished, then I wouldn't count the half  as an empty but in this case, I think counting your work, is best.I would definitely count that lip gloss if it was in my projectCount the lip gloss.  You attempted to finish and used a lot of it.yes count it!Yay so excited to do this with you again next year! You did such a great job with this project! For the gloss you should totally count it as an empty. If you plan to calculate the value of it, you can count half of the full price since you used halfNow this is background i am talking about😍Agree you should count even half or full amount of that gloss-you worked so hard for a long time! The dedication and effort will count towards the other half!Id say mark the gloss as a mini sample size/mini, you finished as much as you could before it went bad!You made great progress this year! You should 100% count the half you finished of that gloss!😊I cant wait to do this again next year! I loooove your eyeshadow btw 😍Also thank you for inspiring me to do my own project pan and using up my products! Because of you, I started a panning journey for myself and I’m getting used to it but I’m getting there!I can’t wait to see you tweak your project pan! I also love your eye look! It’s so gorgeous and compliments your eyes!I would love to join in on this next year!I’d call it a deluxe sample size, you used the heck out of that KVD lip gloss. You worked so hard to make that usage happen you deserve it!I feel like you can count the lip gloss in your empties. Half or more of a full size is still a lot of product that you intentionally used up.Loved the clip of all  the progress! Great idea of reusing the packaging 👍You did so well! :D You're so close on that blush palette!I am so impressed by your blush use up!!  What a great finaleHayleigh! You did such a great job!!!!

You are doing amazing.You got a lot of use out of your bronzer!!Dang 257 times on that bronzer?!?!  Totally worth the money for that.  Sometimes I use facial moisturizer on my hands before bed because I tuck my hands around my face when I sleep,  It keeps me from getting breakouts if I use a face moisturizer.Woohoo way to go!!!

Congrats!Thanks so much for participating with us Ashley!My fantasy self thinks I will use shimmers and colorful eyeshadow instead of nudes and berries :) kick me ! please!You gotta keep control of your fantasy self.  LOL  I'd totally count that as a finished product, especially filming early and cutting it open.  You did great!  Now go take off that red lip and kiss those babies!!  LOLI can't believe that this is over.I wish I was fantasy Nona. Lol! I think all of you that did this project were successful bc you got use out of products that are generally harder to use & that go bad faster. Total win! Love ya, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI wasn't really thinking that I could and should participate next year because I didn't think I had cream products, but seeing all these finales (even though I happily followed the project all year) I think I'm gonna try in the next round... And even though you didn't have huge success, still continued the project all year and not give up is success in itself !Im having that awkward day today. I had a zoom call and i said cringey awkward things. I think you made great progress. Thank you so so much.I definitely have a fantasy Laura as well. 😁 She has a perfectly clean and tidy house.Perfect finale to a wonderful project pan that's lasted a entire year. Can't believe there's just 15 days until Xmas🎅🎄☃️✨!Shoot, it’s not a normal day for me if I don’t have lipstick on my teeth 😅🤣

You are not alone 💋I loved how you did this project!92 is insane!!!! 52 goals met is soooo good!!!!I've said this before, but I really love how you made this project work for sorting through your collection! It has been so satisfying to follow along with you!!! Thank you so much for joining us this year! I am so excited for round 2!Your makeup look is stunning!!!I don’t really use my super shock shadows and have new ones I have yet to even try I thought of just decluttering but idk if it’s still good I’m assuming since i haven’t opened the container maybe they should be fine? Idk lol love your lipstick color!Your makeup is gorgeous!I am definitely doing this project again next year! You made such great progress!This was fun, learned so much about different products TFS 😘I am thinking about doing this next year.  It looks fun!This was such a fun project to follow and I will definitely be joining next year!Oof seeing you declutter the Stila glitter and glow reminds me I should go through my collection and see what needs to be tossed 😅

Prickly Pear would make a gorgeous base for Lituation (abh x Jackie Aina) since that has some purple undertones in it. Pair it with Big Wig that was one of my favorite combos from that palette.Nothing wrong with focusing on the products you can finish this year.If you think about it, if this was #prepthatproduct you would have been very successful! You set yourself up for plenty of empties next year :)If you want something ultra hydrating, the Tarte Maracuja and It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereyes are almost eye cream infused lol. But if you want something closer to the original Urban Decay Naked, you might like the Smashbox Studio Skin, BareMinerals Bareskin, or Becca Ultimate Coverage might be better.I think you did well! 5 products is good!! Thank you so much for joining in this year!!!Yay! You did well this year. :) I think i'm going to join in on this next year. I have lots of cream products to work through.Thank you so much for panning with us this year Paula! I am so excited for next round!That stila blush is soooo pretty!!!!!If you do end up frankening that darkest Elf contour shade, would you please post a video of that (and since it's a cream product... I think that calls for some slow, sultry music... lol... don't you think)?  lol!You made great progress, Beautiful! I am so excited for next yr! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaAlmost! :) You're doing well! Glad to see you using and enjoying products you love. ^_^ I'm joining this project next year too. I think it'll be good for me. :) I haven't really worked on cream products this year, and as such i haven't finished many up. :/I can agree with your thought process, you SHOULD be able to work on something fun and something that you want!This is so great to watch right before your finale 😊🎉💝I bought colour pop lunch money on your recommendation xxLook at that elf palette whoa! 👏🏼👏🏼You do so well with cream and liquid productsI always wish your videos were longer! This was one of my favorite projects this year. So happy its coming back next year!Are you gonna scoop out that cream bronzer and repress it in the center? I’ve never done that with cream products but it sounds satisfying lolI think it's great you are going to focus on the peony blush. It's such a great colour on you. Being able to use a product that just works without faffing takes a tiny bit of stress out of the day.You have made so much progress with the ELF palette and with Lunch Money! 🎉You have made such great progress on the ELF quad.  Oh I like the idea of mixing the light concealer and the dark ELF shade to make a more usable shade.  Oh lunch money is shrinking.  I'm torn on what to bring in for the January intro.I love that this project is coming back!  It’s a good reminder to use those cream products that end up forgotten and could go bad!  I have a huge empty today, a 16 oz tub of Skinn body butter!  I have more In the cabinet but at this time of year, body care products like lotion and cream move fast because I use it day and night.I love watching you pan the elf contour/bronzer palette it's so satisfying.Love that you are going to get to use that blush!You did amazing! Congratulations on your new job 🎉Thank you so much for joining us this year! I am so happy that I connected with you!Congratulations on the job!!!!Aww thank you! I wish we could have a big project panning party/ meet and greet!I'm glad I found you through this project! You did well.

Also, Im loving your new intro 💜awesome finale❤️you did SO good!Love this lipcolor on you😍💖I might need to pick up that Good Molecules primer because right now I need a good hydrating product for my skin. You are doing amazing.You got a lot of use out of your bronzer!!Dang 257 times on that bronzer?!?!  Totally worth the money for that.  Sometimes I use facial moisturizer on my hands before bed because I tuck my hands around my face when I sleep,  It keeps me from getting breakouts if I use a face moisturizer.Woohoo way to go!!! You did so well!Omg Mariela you did so good!It's so awesome to see the pan in the Chanel bronzer. Great job, Gorgeous! stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI am loving your hair and Christmas nails.  Thank you so so much for doing this. I would love to see how many uses the chanel would take to finish 😂😂 You are so close with the good molecules👏Wow really good progress on that primer! I would totally count it as a goal hit!! You did so well overall! Thank you for joining in this year!❤️❤️❤️❤️That Chanel bronzer would take a lifetime to finish. It’s so beautiful though. Great job 👏🏼I want to join. How do we do it?. 
Love your videosI love your eye look! you did so well!You’ve done so well! That bronzer wow just wow!🤩Loving your straight hair! Yay I love finales.Great finale! Wow it would be great to see how long that bronzer would take to finishYAY! Congrats on the pan Lori!! :D We all have bad months. Don't stress. :) Why not try and use the bronzing highlight as a base, then put the matte bronzer on top? Just to mattify it and make it look more like a glow than a shimmer? Colour correctors like that are designed to be used to correct the problem, so when you put a normal coloured concealer on top it doesn't peek through. They need to be slightly darker or else they don't do shit. :) You don't need much. Just a couple of dots and blended out with your finger over the problem area would do. Then normal concealer on top. Take the less is more approach. Also, that lipgloss will definitely be done next month.You inspire me to want to use more cream products. I think they look more natural than powders, but I am combo to oily so I worry abt them breaking down. Love you! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaNice products you have in the project :) I want to join 2021 projeck cream products :) This year I have had low-buy, next year 2021 I will start my no-buy year, because I have too much makeup and beauty products: / Then want to join more projects in 2021 :) Looking forward to the next video from you :) From Ida In Norway :)Nothing wrong with focusing on the products you can finish this year.If you think about it, if this was #prepthatproduct you would have been very successful! You set yourself up for plenty of empties next year :)If you want something ultra hydrating, the Tarte Maracuja and It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereyes are almost eye cream infused lol. But if you want something closer to the original Urban Decay Naked, you might like the Smashbox Studio Skin, BareMinerals Bareskin, or Becca Ultimate Coverage might be better.I think you did well! 5 products is good!! Thank you so much for joining in this year!!!Yay! You did well this year. :) I think i'm going to join in on this next year. I have lots of cream products to work through.You did great! The MAC Paint Pots last FOREVER!!!!!!!!youre so close with that eyeshadow palette!

You have used up so much this year! I can't wait to see your 2021 project!That stila shade looks great on you! Thank you so much for joining us this year! And I am already so excited for next year!!!Tash passionfruit juice is one of the best juices ✨😂 and great project Tash ! 🥰 can’t wait to start this project next year !Awesome update, it's great!
I think everyone does go over the top with sprays....

Passion fruit is delish, I highly reccomend trying desserts flavoured with it, or the fruit itself (if you have the fruit itself, know that it's ripe when it's very wrinkly. Best way to eat it is cutting it in half and scooping the insides out with a spoon. The seeds are crunchy and can be eaten, if you don't prefer them, then you can scoop and seperate out the seeds. All the orange flesh is edible. It's great partnered with a creamy dessert. With an ice cream or creme brulee. Orrrr depending on where you live, you can get passion fruit flavoured yoghurts and such) 

Love that lippy! It suits you really well and it's great for the season! How transferproof is it? Can you wear a mask over it?I really want to do this project next year as well. Thanks for being so inspirational!I love to bathe in face mists too.Panning cream products is definitely my goal for next year! Now that creams are so trendy I have them in my collection and I am so worried about expiry dates.YES someone else finally knows it's passion fruit/lilikoi. I hope you get to try the fruit one day, it's one of my favs, very tart & fragrant.  I have no doubt you'll finish those products in no time.I hope you still continue to pan the stuff you didnt finish so it can be done tooLoved this series! You did awesome! I completely agree with Sarah about The Strand smelling like passion fruit! It smells like passion fruit green tea which is my favorite ☺️but totally understand about if the scent changed and it being weird.That lipstick is gorgeous on you!!I’m loving your lip color it’s so beautiful I love Stila lippies!Just a heads up, I WAS subscribed because I even had your last video in my recommendations but this video didn't come up, when I went to check it said I had unsubscribed! Not sure if this is just me??Did you make that flower board thing? It’s so pretty!You are so beautiful! I love your lip shade today! So excited to do this one again next year! ❤️I love the idea of a refreshI completely understand the setting spray thing. I don't feel like it's even or effective unless my face gets wet, even though I know that means I'm probably using too much 😅Aw YOU are a DELIGHT, a GEM!! 💎

So excited for next year panning and to get updates on ur progress 🎉🎉Amazing job!!!Yaaay i’m the first to comment today 🤩Thank you so much for panning with us this year Paula! I am so excited for next round!That stila blush is soooo pretty!!!!!If you do end up frankening that darkest Elf contour shade, would you please post a video of that (and since it's a cream product... I think that calls for some slow, sultry music... lol... don't you think)?  lol!You made great progress, Beautiful! I am so excited for next yr! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaAlmost! :) You're doing well! Glad to see you using and enjoying products you love. ^_^ I'm joining this project next year too. I think it'll be good for me. :) I haven't really worked on cream products this year, and as such i haven't finished many up. :/I can agree with your thought process, you SHOULD be able to work on something fun and something that you want!This is so great to watch right before your finale 😊🎉💝I bought colour pop lunch money on your recommendation xxLook at that elf palette whoa! 👏🏼👏🏼You do so well with cream and liquid productsI always wish your videos were longer! This was one of my favorite projects this year. So happy its coming back next year!Are you gonna scoop out that cream bronzer and repress it in the center? I’ve never done that with cream products but it sounds satisfying lolI think it's great you are going to focus on the peony blush. It's such a great colour on you. Being able to use a product that just works without faffing takes a tiny bit of stress out of the day.You have made so much progress with the ELF palette and with Lunch Money! 🎉You have made such great progress on the ELF quad.  Oh I like the idea of mixing the light concealer and the dark ELF shade to make a more usable shade.  Oh lunch money is shrinking.  I'm torn on what to bring in for the January intro.I love that this project is coming back!  It’s a good reminder to use those cream products that end up forgotten and could go bad!  I have a huge empty today, a 16 oz tub of Skinn body butter!  I have more In the cabinet but at this time of year, body care products like lotion and cream move fast because I use it day and night.I love watching you pan the elf contour/bronzer palette it's so satisfying.Love that you are going to get to use that blush!Any eye product that burns your eyes...chunk it! You used a lot! Good for you...precious fur baby! xo JaniceThanks for joining this year! I am so excited to see what you put in next year, I have no idea what to suggest.WOW! You finished a ton! Great job Tabitha!Hello puppers!!!Thank you EVERYONE for participating and/or following along. Please don't forget to fill this in by the 15th please :) https://forms.gle/3ikfG9kHBs5oqSgA8You did so well!! I am so excited to see what you put in next year!!Thank you so much Steph!!! I am so happy to have grown a friendship with you!yaay to another round! I was definitely feeling sad it was ending! andTHANK YOU for the wuarterlyy refresh😆 definitelyy needed that!I loved watching this project this year! I’ve signed up for next year to do it on insta & am excited to be a part of it!Hello Steph! Congratulations on your finale! The results are so satisfying! 
I have a question, does nail polish count for this project??? Or only face makeup???
Thanks 💕I love this project so much! 😍 I follow so many people who joined in! 🥰 I myself would love to join in next year!Yay! We get to watch again next year!❤hey steph, i want to have your permission to do skincare edition as I am not a makeup person and have those numbers in control, i would love to get some skincare doneThis was the most exciting project ever! You & DaLin are awesome to have come up with it. Great job, Gorgeous! I can't wait to watch everyone's intros in 2021! Love ya! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaThis is one of the best projects ever.  You did amazing on this project!  I loved all of the ColourPop swatches.  I can't get enough of the super shock shadows."they aren't the same at all... But they are similar" 🤣 me justifying my makeup and nail polish purchasesI'm joining in for 2021. ^_^ Can't wait! You did well this year!Congrats on this project👍🏼🎉Wonderful job!   I will be doing this project next yearyou two created an amazing project pan and i am excited to do it again!! you also did so well!!Thanks to you for creating this. 

I loved it, I focused it on non make up items because one of my goals for 2020 was to included as many make up as I could in the project and so far I had to much going on. Next year I may be more challenging for me picking uo product that may stoy all year, but I don't mind, they ones I am thinking of are long term products anyway and for that reason are very neglected. If I want I can do a refresh so I think is pretty ok. 

Ah, I also prefer having tiem after projects to just not worry about usage so I tipically end or start my year long project before or after, I normally do a PTP from middle Jan to mid Dec, and I have time to enjoy other things.

HughesEvery time you show the jelly shadows I drool a little. They're just so yummy when you swatch them. See you for next year where we will both be driven insane by Colour Tattoos again. I've got a ton more too 😢You did amazing, and again thank you thank you thank you for starting this project with DaLin! Can't wait to join again next year 😊Well done Steph!

You certainly aim high Bettina!I think you did really well. Especially considering that you started in August! Thank you for joining this year!Great job!I think you did really well. Especially considering that you started in August! Thank you for joining this year!Great job!Thanks so much for participating with us Ashley!My fantasy self thinks I will use shimmers and colorful eyeshadow instead of nudes and berries :) kick me ! please!You gotta keep control of your fantasy self.  LOL  I'd totally count that as a finished product, especially filming early and cutting it open.  You did great!  Now go take off that red lip and kiss those babies!!  LOLI can't believe that this is over.I wish I was fantasy Nona. Lol! I think all of you that did this project were successful bc you got use out of products that are generally harder to use & that go bad faster. Total win! Love ya, Gorgeous! Stay safe! TFS! ~ NonaI wasn't really thinking that I could and should participate next year because I didn't think I had cream products, but seeing all these finales (even though I happily followed the project all year) I think I'm gonna try in the next round... And even though you didn't have huge success, still continued the project all year and not give up is success in itself !Im having that awkward day today. I had a zoom call and i said cringey awkward things. I think you made great progress. Thank you so so much.I definitely have a fantasy Laura as well. 😁 She has a perfectly clean and tidy house.Perfect finale to a wonderful project pan that's lasted a entire year. Can't believe there's just 15 days until Xmas🎅🎄☃️✨!Shoot, it’s not a normal day for me if I don’t have lipstick on my teeth 😅🤣
